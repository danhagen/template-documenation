@article{Blaya2004,
   abstract = {An active ankle-foot orthoses (AAFO) is presented where the impedance of the orthotic joint is modulated throughout the walking cycle to treat drop-foot gait. During controlled plantar flexion, a biomimetic torsional spring control is applied where orthotic joint stiffness is actively adjusted to minimize forefoot collisions with the ground. Throughout late stance, joint impedance is minimized so as not to impede powered plantar flexion movements, and during the swing phase, a torsional spring-damper control lifts the foot to provide toe clearance. To assess the clinical effects of variable-impedance control, kinetic and kinematic gait data were collected on two drop-foot participants wearing the AAFO. For each participant, zero, constant, and variable impedance control strategies were evaluated and the results were compared to the mechanics of three age, weight, and height matched normals. We find that actively adjusting joint impedance reduces the occurrence of slap foot allows greater powered plantar flexion and provides for less kinematic difference during swing when compared to normals. These results indicate that a variable-impedance orthosis may have certain clinical benefits for the treatment of drop-foot gait compared to conventional ankle-foot orthoses having zero or constant stiffness joint behaviors.},

   abstract = {Although humans have a large repertoire of potential movements, gait patterns tend to be stereotypical and appear to be selected according to optimality principles such as minimal energy. When applied to dynamic musculoskeletal models such optimality principles might be used to predict how a patient's gait adapts to mechanical interventions such as prosthetic devices or surgery. In this paper we study the effects of different performance criteria on predicted gait patterns using a 2D musculoskeletal model. The associated optimal control problem for a family of different cost functions was solved utilizing the direct collocation method. It was found that fatigue-like cost functions produced realistic gait, with stance phase knee flexion, as opposed to energy-related cost functions which avoided knee flexion during the stance phase. We conclude that fatigue minimization may be one of the primary optimality principles governing human gait.},

   abstract = {The proposition that dynamic optimization provides better estimates of muscle forces during gait than static optimization is examined by comparing a dynamic solution with two static solutions. A 23-degree-of-freedom musculoskeletal model actuated by 54 Hill-type musculotendon units was used to simulate one cycle of normal gait. The dynamic problem was to find the muscle excitations which minimized metabolic energy per unit distance traveled, and which produced a repeatable gait cycle. In the dynamic problem, activation dynamics was described by a first-order differential equation. The joint moments predicted by the dynamic solution were used as input to the static problems. In each static problem, the problem was to find the muscle activations which minimized the sum of muscle activations squared, and which generated the joint moments input from the dynamic solution. In the first static problem, muscles were treated as ideal force generators; in the second, they were constrained by their force-length-velocity properties; and in both, activation dynamics was neglected. In terms of predicted muscle forces and joint contact forces, the dynamic and static solutions were remarkably similar. Also, activation dynamics and the force-length-velocity properties of muscle had little influence on the static solutions. Thus, for normal gait, if one can accurately solve the inverse dynamics problem and if one seeks only to estimate muscle forces, the use of dynamic optimization rather than static optimization is currently not justified. Scenarios in which the use of dynamic optimization is justified are suggested.},

   abstract = {The question posed in this study is whether optimal control and state estimation can explain selection of control strategies used by humans, in response to small perturbations to stable upright balance. To answer this question, a human sensorimotor control model, compatible with previous work by others, was assembled. This model incorporates linearized equations and full-state feedback with provision for state estimation. A form of gain-scheduling is employed to account for nonlinearities caused by control and biomechanical constraints. By decoupling the mechanics and transforming the controls into the space of experimentally observed strategies, the model is made amenable to the study of a number of possible control objectives. The objectives studied include cost functions on the state deviations, so as to control the center of mass, provide a stable platform for the head, or maintain upright stance, along with a cost function on control effort. Also studied was the effect of time delay on the stability of controls produced using various control strategies. An objective function weighting excursion of the center of mass and deviations from the upright stable position, while taking advantage of fast modes of the system, as dictated by inertial parameters and musculoskeletal geometry, produces a control that reasonably matches experimental data. Given estimates of sensor performance, the model is also suited for prediction of uncertainty in the response.},

An accurate and predictive mathematical model can facilitate the design of stimulation patterns that produce the desired force. The present study is a first step in developing a mathematical model for non-isometric muscle contractions. The goals of this study were to: (1) identify how our isometric force model's parameters vary with changes in knee joint angle, (2) identify the best knee flexion angle to parameterize this model, and (3) validate the model by comparing experimental data to predictions in response to a wide range of stimulation frequencies and muscle lengths. Results showed that by parabolically varying one of the free parameters with knee joint angle and fixing the other parameters at the values identified at 40 degrees of knee flexion, the model could predict the force responses to a wide range of stimulation frequencies and patterns at different muscle lengths. This work showed that the current isometric force model is capable of predicting the changes in skeletal muscle force at different muscle lengths.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Direct electrical activation of skeletal muscles of patients with upper motor neuron lesions can restore functional movements, such as standing or walking. Because responses to electrical stimulation are highly nonlinear and time varying, accurate control of muscles to produce functional movements is very difficult. Accurate and predictive mathematical models can facilitate the design of stimulation patterns and control strategies that will produce the desired force and motion. In the present study, we build upon our previous isometric model to capture the effects of constant angular velocity on the forces produced during electrically elicited concentric contractions of healthy human quadriceps femoris muscle. Modelling the isovelocity condition is important because it will enable us to understand how our model behaves under the relatively simple condition of constant velocity and will enable us to better understand the interactions of muscle length, limb velocity, and stimulation pattern on the force produced by the muscle.

METHODS: An additional term was introduced into our previous isometric model to predict the force responses during constant velocity limb motion. Ten healthy subjects were recruited for the study. Using a KinCom dynamometer, isometric and isovelocity force data were collected from the human quadriceps femoris muscle in response to a wide range of stimulation frequencies and patterns. % error, linear regression trend lines, and paired t-tests were used to test how well the model predicted the experimental forces. In addition, sensitivity analysis was performed using Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test to obtain a measure of the sensitivity of our model's output to changes in model parameters.

RESULTS: Percentage RMS errors between modelled and experimental forces determined for each subject at each stimulation pattern and velocity showed that the errors were in general less than 20%. The coefficients of determination between the measured and predicted forces show that the model accounted for approximately 86% and approximately 85% of the variances in the measured force-time integrals and peak forces, respectively.

CONCLUSION: The range of predictive abilities of the isovelocity model in response to changes in muscle length, velocity, and stimulation frequency for each individual make it ideal for dynamic applications like FES cycling.},

   abstract = {The authors intend to utilize a lower limb exoskeleton for gait assistance in individuals with lower limb neuromuscular deficit. The authors suggest that two foundational elements are required to do so effectively. First, the exoskeleton system must be capable of reliable real-time gait phase detection, in order to determine the nature of gait assistance to provide. Second, in gait phases or circumstances in which the exoskeleton provides minimal assistance, the passive dynamics of the exoskeleton should not hinder the individual (i.e., should have the capability to minimally interfere with gait dynamics). As such, the exoskeleton system should be capable of actively compensating for its passive dynamics, namely the inertial, gravitational, and frictional effects it imposes on the user. This paper describes the implementation of these two foundational elements (real-time gait phase detection and active cancellation of passive dynamics) on a prototype lower limb exoskeleton, and provides experimental data demonstrating their respective efficacy.},

A satisfactory amount of energy has been harvested as electric power in both configurations. The realization of nonlinear vibration control through one-way irreversible nonlinear energy pumping and optimizing the system parameters result in acquiring up to 78 percent dissipation of the grounded system energy.},

   abstract = {To accurately estimate muscle forces using electromyogram (EMG) signals two fundamental steps are necessary: first, precise EMG amplitude estimation, and second a modeling scheme capable of coping with the non-linearities and dynamics of the EMG-force relationship. In this work, angle-based EMG amplitude calibration and parallel cascade identification (PCI) modeling have been combined to address the issue of EMG force estimation in dynamic contractions including concentric and eccentric contractions of the biceps brachii and triceps brachii muscles. The contractions were performed at a range of joint angles (15 to 105 ) and forces (0 to 30 N). Angle-based calibration has been shown to improve surface EMG (SEMG) based force estimation during isometric contractions through minimization of the effects of joint angle related factors and PCI modeling captures both the nonlinear and dynamic properties of the process being modeled. SEMG data recorded during constant force, constant velocity, and varying force, varying velocity flexion and extension trials were calibrated. The calibration values were obtained at specific elbow joint angles and then interpolated to cover the continuous range of joint angles under study. The calibrated data were then used in PCI models to estimate the force induced at the wrist. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the calibration scheme and the choice of interpolation method in improving the force estimation accuracy, and the superior performance of PCI compared to an orthogonalization method that does not explicitly model the system dynamics (p < 0:01). For the constant force, constant velocity trials, minimum %RMSE of 8.3% was achieved for concentric contractions with calibration; minimum %RMSE values increased to 10.3% for eccentric contractions and to 33.3% for fully dynamic contractions. Force estimation accuracy was superior in concentric contractions in comparison to eccentric contractions (p < 0:01), which may be indicative of more nonlinearity in the eccentric SEMG-force relationship.},

Movement generation induced by FES remains mostly open looped and stimulus intensities are tuned empirically. To design an efficient closed-loop control, a preliminary study has been carried out to investigate the relationship between body posture and voluntary upper body movements. A methodology is proposed to estimate body posture in the sagittal plane using force measurements exerted on supporting handles during standing. This is done by setting up constraints related to the geometric equations of a two-dimensional closed chain model and the hand-handle interactions. All measured quantities are subject to an uncertainty assumed unknown but bounded. The set membership estimation problem is solved via interval analysis. Guaranteed uncertainty bounds are computed for the estimated postures. In order to test the feasibility of our methodology, experiments were carried out with complete spinal cord injured patients.},

   abstract = {Locomotor training using body weight support on a treadmill and manual assistance is a promising rehabilitation technique following neurological injuries, such as spinal cord injury (SCI) and stroke. Previous robots that automate this technique impose constraints on naturalistic walking due to their kinematic structure, and are typically operated in a stiff mode, limiting the ability of the patient or human trainer to influence the stepping pattern. We developed a pneumatic gait training robot that allows for a full range of natural motion of the legs and pelvis during treadmill walking, and provides compliant assistance. However, we observed an unexpected consequence of the device's compliance: unimpaired and SCI individuals invariably began walking out-of-phase with the device. Thus, the robot perturbed rather than assisted stepping. To address this problem, we developed a novel algorithm that synchronizes the device in real-time to the actual motion of the individual by sensing the state error and adjusting the replay timing to reduce this error. This paper describes data from experiments with individuals with SCI that demonstrate the effectiveness of the synchronization algorithm, and the potential of the device for relieving the trainers of strenuous work while maintaining naturalistic stepping.},

   abstract = {Robotic training paradigms that enforce a fixed kinematic control might be suboptimal for rehabilitative training because they abolish variability, an intrinsic property of neuromuscular control (Jezernik et al., 2003). In the present study we introduce "assist-as-needed" (AAN) robotic training paradigms for rehabilitation of spinal cord injury subjects. To test the efficacy of these robotic control strategies to teach spinal mice to step, we divided 27 adult female Swiss-Webster mice randomly into three groups. Each group was trained robotically by using one of three control strategies: a fixed training trajectory (Fixed group), an AAN training paradigm without interlimb coordination (Band group), and an AAN training paradigm with bilateral hindlimb coordination (Window group). Beginning at 14 d after a complete midthoracic spinal cord transection, the mice were trained daily (10 min/d, 5 d/week) to step on a treadmill 10 min after the administration of quipazine (0.5 mg/kg), a serotonin agonist, for a period of 6 weeks. During weekly performance evaluations, the mice trained with the AAN window paradigm generally showed the highest level of recovery as measured by the number, consistency, and periodicity of steps during the testing sessions. In all three measurements there were no significant differences between the Band and the Fixed training groups. These results indicate that the window training approach, which includes loose alternating interlimb coordination, is more effective than a fixed trajectory paradigm with rigid alternating interlimb coordination or an AAN paradigm without any interlimb constraints in promoting robust postinjury stepping behavior.},

The application of robotics and automation technology can serve to assist, enhance, evaluate, and document neurological and orthopedic rehabilitation. This paper deals with the application of "patient-cooperative" techniques to robot-aided gait rehabilitation of neurological disorders. We define patient-cooperative to mean that, during movement, the technical system takes into account the patient's intention and voluntary efforts rather than imposing any predefined movements or inflexible strategies. It is hypothesized that such cooperative robotic approaches can improve the therapeutic outcome compared to classical rehabilitation strategies. New cooperative strategies are presented that detect the patient's voluntary efforts. First, this enables the patient increased freedom of movement by a certain amount of robot compliance. Second, the robot behavior adapts to the existing voluntary motor abilities. And third, the robotic system displays and improves the patient contribution by visual biofeedback. Initial experimental results are presented to evaluate the basic principle and technical function of proposed approaches. Further improvements of the technical design and additional clinical testing is required to prove whether the therapeutic outcome can be enhanced by such cooperative strategies.},

The specific unit operations associated with the purification and processing of API have been developed from first-principles and connected in a continuous framework in the form of a flowsheet model. These integrated unit operations are highly interactive along with the presence of process delays. Therefore, a hybrid MPC-PID is a promising alternative to achieve the desired control loop performance as mandated by the regulatory authorities. The integrated flowsheet model has been simulated in gPROMS™ (Process System Enterprise, London, UK). This flowsheet model has been [1.0]linearized in order to design the control scheme. The ability to track the set point and reject disturbances has been evaluated. A comparative study between the performance of the hybrid MPC-PID and a PID-only control scheme has been presented. The results show that an enhanced control loop performance can be obtained under the hybrid control scheme and demonstrate that such a scheme has high potential in improving the efficiency of pharmaceutical manufacturing operations.},

We presumed that the residual sensory pathways were critical in this recovery. However, we now report in three more individuals voluntary movement occurred with epidural stimulation immediately after implant even in two who were diagnosed with a motor and sensory complete lesion. We demonstrate that neuromodulating the spinal circuitry with epidural stimulation, enables completely paralysed individuals to process conceptual, auditory and visual input to regain relatively fine voluntary control of paralysed muscles. We show that neuromodulation of the sub-threshold motor state of excitability of the lumbosacral spinal networks was the key to recovery of intentional movement in four of four individuals diagnosed as having complete paralysis of the legs. We have uncovered a fundamentally new intervention strategy that can dramatically affect recovery of voluntary movement in individuals with complete paralysis even years after injury.},

A Hill-type time series model, in which the output is the product of two factors (activation and torque-angle) is used. In this coupled model, the activation dynamics depend upon velocity. Sequential nonlinear least squares methods are used in the parameter identification. The ability of the model, using identified time-varying parameters, to accurately predict muscle torque outputs is evaluated, along with the variability of the identified parameters. This technique can be used to determine muscle parameter models for biomechanical computer simulations, and for real-time adaptive control and monitoring of muscle response variations such as fatigue.},

The effect on skin temperature was also assessed using a skin thermistor. Thirty healthy human volunteers were recruited and randomly assigned to a control or one of the two treatment groups. TENS was applied to the skin overlying the median nerve under double-blind conditions for 15 min. Blood flow and skin temperature readings were recorded pre-TENS, during TENS application and continued for 15 min post-TENS application. Analysis of results showed significant increases in blood perfusion during the treatment period in the low-frequency group when compared to the other two groups (P = 0.0106; ANOVA). No significant changes in skin temperature were observed. The results of this study demonstrate that low-frequency TENS produces a local increase in cutaneous blood flow.},

Use of electrical stimulation is a medium in which investigators have tried to find a way to restore movement and the ability to perform activities of daily living. Different methods of applying electrical current to modify neuromuscular activity are electrical stimulation (ES), neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES), transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), and functional electrical stimulation (FES). This review covers the aspects of electrical stimulation used for rehabilitation and functional purposes. Discussed are the various parameters of electrical stimulation, including frequency, pulse width/duration, duty cycle, intensity/amplitude, ramp time, pulse pattern, program duration, program frequency, and muscle group activated, and how they affect fatigue in the stimulated muscle.},

In particular, the paper presents a single-subject case study comparing legged locomotion using the exoskeleton to locomotion using knee-ankle-foot orthoses (KAFOs) on a subject with a T10 motor and sensory complete injury. The assessment utilizes three assessment instruments to characterize legged mobility, which are the timed up-and-go test, the Ten-Meter Walk Test (10 MWT), and the Six-Minute Walk Test (6 MWT), which collectively assess the subject's ability to stand, walk, turn, and sit. The exertion associated with each assessment instrument was assessed using the Physiological Cost Index. Results indicate that the subject was able to perform the respective assessment instruments 25%, 70%, and 80% faster with the exoskeleton relative to the KAFOs for the timed up-and-go test, the 10 MWT, and the 6 MWT, respectively. Measurements of exertion indicate that the exoskeleton requires 1.6, 5.2, and 3.2 times less exertion than the KAFOs for each respective assessment instrument. The results indicate that the enhancement in speed and reduction in exertion are more significant during walking than during gait transitions.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of the Odstock Dropped-Foot Stimulator (ODFS), a transcutaneous peroneal nerve stimulation device, versus an ankle foot orthosis (AFO) in improving functional ambulation of chronic stroke survivors.

INTERVENTION: Fourteen chronic stroke survivors with foot-drop participated in the study. Participants received ambulation training under 3 test conditions: 1) ODFS, 2) customized AFO, and 3) no device. Each participant was evaluated using the modified Emory Functional Ambulation Profile under the 3 test conditions. All participants were evaluated with a post-evaluation survey to solicit device feedback and preferences.

RESULTS: Functional ambulation with the AFO was significantly improved, relative to no device, on the floor (P = 0.000), carpet (P = 0.013), and "up and go" test (P = 0.042). There was a trend toward significance on the obstacle (P = 0.092) and stair (P = 0.067) trials. Functional ambulation with the ODFS was significantly improved, relative to no device, on the carpet(P = 0.004). A trend toward significance on floor (P = 0.081), obstacle (P = 0.092), and stair (P = 0.079) trials was observed. The difference in functional ambulation between the AFO and ODFS showed a trend toward statistical significance on floor (P = 0.065) and up and go (P = 0.082) trials only. Given a choice between the ODFS and AFO for long-term correction of footdrop, participants indicated a preference for the ODFS.

CONCLUSION: The AFO and the ODFS may be comparable in their effect on improving functional ambulation as compared to no device. Specific characteristics of the ODFS may make it a preferred intervention by stroke survivors. More rigorously controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings.},

@article{Vallery2009,
   abstract = {For gait rehabilitation robots, an important question is how to ensure stable gait, while avoiding any interaction forces between robot and human in case the patient walks correctly. To achieve this, the definition of "correct" gait needs to adapted both to the individual patient and to the situation. Recently, we proposed a method for online trajectory generation that can be applied for hemiparetic subjects. Desired states for one (disabled) leg are generated online based on the movements of the other (sound) leg. An instantaneous mapping between legs is performed by exploiting physiological interjoint couplings. This way, the patient generates the reference motion for the affected leg autonomously. The approach, called Complementary Limb Motion Estimation (CLME), is implemented on the LOPES gait rehabilitation robot and evaluated with healthy subjects in two different experiments. In a previously described study, subjects walk only with one leg, while the robot's other leg acts as a fake prosthesis, to simulate complete loss of function in one leg. This study showed that CLME ensures stable gait. In a second study, to be presented in this paper, healthy subjects walk with both their own legs to assess the interference with self-determined walking. Evaluation criteria are: Power delivered to the joints by the robot, electromyography (EMG) distortions, and kinematic distortions, all compared to zero torque control, which is the baseline of minimum achievable interference. Results indicate that interference of the robot is lower with CLME than with a fixed reference trajectory, mainly in terms of lowered exchanged power and less alteration of EMG. This implies that subjects can walk more naturally with CLME, and they are assisted less by the robot when it is not needed. Future studies with patients are yet to show whether these properties of CLME transfer to the clinical domain.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Functional electrical stimulation (FES) serves as a possible therapy to restore missing motor functions of peripheral nerves by means of cuff electrodes. FES is established for improving lower limb function. Transferring this method to the upper extremity is complex, due to a lack of anatomical data on the physiological configuration of nerve fascicles. Our study's aim was to provide an anatomical basis for FES of the median nerve in the distal forearm and hand.

METHODS: We investigated 21 distal median nerves from 12 body donors. The peripheral fascicles were traced back by removing the external and interfascicular epineurium and then assigned to 4 quadrants.

RESULTS: A distinct motor and sensory distribution was observed. The fascicles innervating the thenar eminence and the first lumbrical muscle originated from the nerves' radial parts in 82%. The fascicle supplying the second lumbrical muscle originated from the ulnar side in 78%. No macroscopically visible plexus formation was observed for the distal median nerve in the forearm.

CONCLUSIONS: The findings on the distribution of the motor branches of the median nerve and the missing plexus formation may likely serve as an anatomical basis for FES of the distal forearm. However, due to the considerable variability of the motor branches, cuff electrodes will need to be adapted individually in FES. Taking into account the sensory distribution of the median nerve, FES may also possibly be applied in the treatment of regional pain syndromes.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many neurological conditions, such as stroke, spinal cord injury, and traumatic brain injury, can cause chronic gait function impairment due to foot-drop. Current physiotherapy techniques provide only a limited degree of motor function recovery in these individuals, and therefore novel therapies are needed. Brain-computer interface (BCI) is a relatively novel technology with a potential to restore, substitute, or augment lost motor behaviors in patients with neurological injuries. Here, we describe the first successful integration of a noninvasive electroencephalogram (EEG)-based BCI with a noninvasive functional electrical stimulation (FES) system that enables the direct brain control of foot dorsiflexion in able-bodied individuals.

METHODS: A noninvasive EEG-based BCI system was integrated with a noninvasive FES system for foot dorsiflexion. Subjects underwent computer-cued epochs of repetitive foot dorsiflexion and idling while their EEG signals were recorded and stored for offline analysis. The analysis generated a prediction model that allowed EEG data to be analyzed and classified in real time during online BCI operation. The real-time online performance of the integrated BCI-FES system was tested in a group of five able-bodied subjects who used repetitive foot dorsiflexion to elicit BCI-FES mediated dorsiflexion of the contralateral foot.

RESULTS: Five able-bodied subjects performed 10 alternations of idling and repetitive foot dorsifiexion to trigger BCI-FES mediated dorsifiexion of the contralateral foot. The epochs of BCI-FES mediated foot dorsifiexion were highly correlated with the epochs of voluntary foot dorsifiexion (correlation coefficient ranged between 0.59 and 0.77) with latencies ranging from 1.4 sec to 3.1 sec. In addition, all subjects achieved a 100% BCI-FES response (no omissions), and one subject had a single false alarm.

CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the integration of a noninvasive BCI with a lower-extremity FES system is feasible. With additional modifications, the proposed BCI-FES system may offer a novel and effective therapy in the neuro-rehabilitation of individuals with lower extremity paralysis due to neurological injuries.},

   abstract = {AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate feedback control strategies for integration of electric motor assist and functional electrical stimulation (FES) for paraplegic cycling, with particular focus on development of a testbed for exercise testing in FES cycling, in which both cycling cadence and workrate are simultaneously well controlled and contemporary physiological measures of exercise performance derived. A second aim was to investigate the possible benefits of the approach for mobile, recreational cycling.

METHODS: A recumbent tricycle with an auxiliary electric motor is used, which is adapted for paraplegic users, and instrumented for stimulation control. We propose a novel integrated control strategy which simultaneously provides feedback control of leg power output (via automatic adjustment of stimulation intensity) and cycling cadence (via electric motor control). Both loops are designed using system identification and analytical (model-based) feedback design methods. Ventilatory and pulmonary gas exchange response profiles are derived using a portable system for real-time breath-by-breath acquisition.

RESULTS: We provide indicative results from one paraplegic subject in which a series of feedback-control tests illustrate accurate control of cycling cadence, leg power control, and external disturbance rejection. We also provide physiological response profiles from a submaximal exercise step test and a maximal incremental exercise test, as facilitated by the control strategy.

CONCLUSION: The integrated control strategy is effective in facilitating exercise testing under conditions of well-controlled cadence and power output. Our control approach significantly extends the achievable workrate range and enhances exercise-test sensitivity for FES cycling, thus allowing a more stringent characterization of physiological response profiles and estimation of key parameters of aerobic function. We further conclude that the control approach can significantly improve the overall performance of mobile recreational cycling.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Here we developed and tested a novel system for early motor rehabilitation in acute stroke when patients are unable to stand and walk without assistance. Stepping performance may be largely facilitated by providing treatment in the supine position on a tilt table using step-synchronized functional electrical stimulation (FES) with assisted leg movements and progressive limb loading.

METHODS: Sixty-one individuals with acute stroke were randomly assigned to two groups, experimental and control. The first group received both a conventional therapy and FES-therapy combined with progressive limb loading, whereas the control group received a conventional therapy only. Changes after treatment were assessed using clinical scores and neurophysiological measurements of movement performance.

RESULTS: After treatment, there was an improvement of the clinical scores, muscle forces and everyday life activity performance in both groups, however, significantly higher in the experimental group. Active rhythmic movements of the non paretic leg often provoked muscle activity in the paretic leg as well as there was a reduction of the contralateral leg muscle contraction during paretic leg movements.

CONCLUSION: The developed FES and leg displacement-assisted therapy facilitates a smooth transition to walking in the vertical position and increases the patient's functional abilities and the effectiveness of rehabilitation.},

   abstract = {Particular neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) applications require the use of the same electrodes over a long duration (>1 day) without having access to them. Under such circumstance the quality of the electrode-skin contact cannot be assessed. We used the NMES signal itself to assess the quality of the electrode-skin contact and the electrical properties of the underlying tissues over a week. A 14% decrease in the skin's stratum corneum resistance (from 20 to 17 kΩ) and a 15% decrease in the resistance of the electrodes and underlying tissues (from 550 to 460 Ω) were observed in the 14 healthy subjects investigated. A follow-on investigation of the effect of exercise-induced sweating on the electrical properties of the electrode-skin-underlying tissue composite during NMES indicated a correlation between the decrease in the resistance values observed over the course of the week and the accumulation of sweat at the electrode-skin interface. The value of the capacitance representing the dielectric properties of the skin's stratum corneum increased after exercise-induced sweating but did not change significantly over the course of the week. We conclude that valuable information about the electrode-skin-underlying tissue composite can be gathered using the NMES signal itself, and suggest that this is a practical, safe and relatively simple method for monitoring these electrical properties during long-term stimulation.},

We have developed a freely available, open-source software system (OpenSim) that lets users develop models of musculoskeletal structures and create dynamic simulations of a wide variety of movements. We are using this system to simulate the dynamics of individuals with pathological gait and to explore the biomechanical effects of treatments. OpenSim provides a platform on which the biomechanics community can build a library of simulations that can be exchanged, tested, analyzed, and improved through a multi-institutional collaboration. Developing software that enables a concerted effort from many investigators poses technical and sociological challenges. Meeting those challenges will accelerate the discovery of principles that govern movement control and improve treatments for individuals with movement pathologies.},

Although effective at their intended gait speed and terrain, these controllers do not allow for adaptation to environmental disturbances such as speed transients and terrain variation. Here we present an adaptive muscle-reflex controller, based on simulation studies, that utilizes an ankle plantar flexor comprising a Hill-type muscle with a positive force feedback reflex. The model's parameters were fitted to match the human ankle's torque-angle profile as obtained from level-ground walking measurements of a weight and height-matched intact subject walking at 1 m/s. Using this single parameter set, clinical trials were conducted with a transtibial amputee walking on level ground, ramp ascent, and ramp descent conditions. During these trials, an adaptation of prosthetic ankle work was observed in response to ground slope variation, in a manner comparable to intact subjects, without the difficulties of explicit terrain sensing. Specifically, the energy provided by the prosthesis was directly correlated to the ground slope angle. This study highlights the importance of neuromuscular controllers for enhancing the adaptiveness of powered prosthetic devices across varied terrain surfaces.},

   abstract = {Several recent studies on the control of legged locomotion in animal and robot running focus on the influence of different leg parameters on gait stability. In a preceding investigation self-stability controls showing deadbeat behavior could be obtained by studying the dynamics of the system in dependence of the leg orientation carefully adjusted during the flight phase. Such controls allow to accommodate disturbances of the ground level without having to detect them. Here we further this method in two ways. Besides the leg orientation, we allow changes in leg stiffness during flight and show that this extension substantially improves the rejection of ground disturbances. In a human like example the tolerance of random variation in ground level over many steps increased from 3.5% to 35% of leg length. In single steps changes of about 70% leg length (either up or down) could be negotiated. The variable leg stiffness not only allows to start with flat leg orientations maximizing step tolerances but also increase the control subspace. This allows to customize self-stability controls and to consider physical and technical limitations found in animals and robots.},

   abstract = {The planar spring-mass model is frequently used to describe bouncing gaits (running, hopping, trotting, galloping) in animal and human locomotion and robotics. Although this model represents a rather simple mechanical system, an analytical solution predicting the center of mass trajectory during stance remains open. We derive an approximate solution in elementary functions assuming a small angular sweep and a small spring compression during stance. The predictive power and quality of this solution is investigated for model parameters relevant to human locomotion. The analysis shows that (i), for spring compressions of up to 20% (angle of attack > or = 60 degree, angular sweep < or = 60 degree) the approximate solution describes the stance dynamics of the center of mass within a 1% tolerance of spring compression and 0.6 degree tolerance of angular motion compared to numerical calculations, and (ii), despite its relative simplicity, the approximate solution accurately predicts stable locomotion well extending into the physiologically reasonable parameter domain. (iii) Furthermore, in a particular case, an explicit parametric dependency required for gait stability can be revealed extending an earlier, empirically found relationship. It is suggested that this approximation of the planar spring-mass dynamics may serve as an analytical tool for application in robotics and further research on legged locomotion.},

Here, we show that muscle reflexes could be vital to link these two observations. We develop a model of human locomotion that is controlled by muscle reflexes which encode principles of legged mechanics. Equipped with this reflex control, we find this model to stabilize into a walking gait from its dynamic interplay with the ground, reproduce human walking dynamics and leg kinematics, tolerate ground disturbances, and adapt to slopes without parameter interventions. In addition, we find this model to predict some individual muscle activation patterns known from walking experiments. The results suggest not only that the interplay between mechanics and motor control is essential to human locomotion, but also that human motor output could for some muscles be dominated by neural circuits that encode principles of legged mechanics.},

   abstract = {The adjustment of the leg during running was addressed using a spring-mass model with a fixed landing angle of attack. The objective was to obtain periodic movement patterns. Spring-like running was monitored by a one-dimensional stride-to-stride mapping of the apex height to identify mechanically stable fixed points. We found that for certain angles of attack, the system becomes self-stabilized if the leg stiffness was properly adjusted and a minimum running speed was exceeded. At a given speed, running techniques fulfilling a stable movement pattern are characterized by an almost constant maximum leg force. With increasing speed, the leg adjustment becomes less critical. The techniques predicted for stable running are in agreement with experimental studies. Mechanically self-stabilized running requires a spring-like leg operation, a minimum running speed and a proper adjustment of leg stiffness and angle of attack. These conditions can be considered as a movement criterion for running.},

Interactive or assist-as-needed (AAN) gait training encourages patient voluntary participation in the robotic gait training process which may aid in rapid motor function recovery. In this paper, a lightweight robotic gait training orthosis with two actuated and four passive degrees of freedom (DOFs) is proposed. The actuated DOFs were powered by pneumatic muscle actuators. An AAN gait training paradigm based on adaptive impedance control was developed to provide interactive robotic gait training. The proposed adaptive impedance control scheme adapts the robotic assistance according to the disability level and voluntary participation of human subjects. The robotic orthosis was operated in two gait training modes, namely, inactive mode and active mode, to evaluate the performance of the proposed control scheme. The adaptive impedance control scheme was evaluated on ten neurologically intact subjects. The experimental results demonstrate that an increase in voluntary participation of human subjects resulted in a decrease of the robotic assistance and vice versa. Further clinical evaluations with neurologically impaired subjects are required to establish the therapeutic efficacy of the adaptive-impedance-control-based AAN gait training strategy.},

   abstract = {Numerical simulations play an important role in solving complex engineering problems and have the potential to revolutionize medical decision making and treatment strategies. In this paper, we combine the rapid model-based design, control systems and powerful numerical method strengths of MATLAB/Simulink with the simulation and human movement dynamics strengths of OpenSim by developing a new interface between the two software tools. OpenSim is integrated with Simulink using the MATLAB S-function mechanism, and the interface is demonstrated using both open-loop and closed-loop control systems. While the open-loop system uses MATLAB/Simulink to separately reproduce the OpenSim Forward Dynamics Tool, the closed-loop system adds the unique feature of feedback control to OpenSim, which is necessary for most human movement simulations. An arm model example was successfully used in both open-loop and closed-loop cases. For the open-loop case, the simulation reproduced results from the OpenSim Forward Dynamics Tool with root mean square (RMS) differences of 0.03° for the shoulder elevation angle and 0.06° for the elbow flexion angle. MATLAB's variable step-size integrator reduced the time required to generate the forward dynamic simulation from 7.1s (OpenSim) to 2.9s (MATLAB). For the closed-loop case, a proportional-integral-derivative controller was used to successfully balance a pole on model's hand despite random force disturbances on the pole. The new interface presented here not only integrates the OpenSim and MATLAB/Simulink software tools, but also will allow neuroscientists, physiologists, biomechanists, and physical therapists to adapt and generate new solutions as treatments for musculoskeletal conditions.},

Artificial neural networks (ANNs) were trained to use three-dimensional trunk acceleration as input to predict changes in COP for able-bodied subjects undergoing perturbations during bipedal stance. Correlation coefficients between ANN predictions and actual COP ranged from 0.67 to 0.77. An ANN trained across all subject-normalized data was used to drive feedback control of ankle muscle excitation levels for a computer model representing a standing neuroprosthesis user. Feedback control reduced average upper-body loading during perturbation onset and recovery by 42% and peak loading by 29% compared with optimal, constant excitation.},

The muscle model consists of three factors: a muscle activation dynamics factor, an angle-torque relationship factor, and an angular velocity torque relationship factor. These factors are multiplied to relate output torque to input stimulation and joint angle. An experimental method for the determination of the parameters of this model was designed, implemented, and evaluated. An open-loop nonlinear compensator, based upon this model, was tested in an animal model. Its performance in the control of joint angle in the presence of a known load was compared with a PID controller, and with a combination of the PID controller and the nonlinear compensator. The performance of the nonlinear compensator appeared to be strongly dependent on modeling errors. Its performance was roughly equivalent to that of the PID controller alone: somewhat better when the model was accurate, and somewhat worse when it was inaccurate. Combining the nonlinear open loop compensator with the PID feedback controller improved performance when the model was accurate.},

A standardized telephone survey was administered to 11 recipients of the Case Western Reserve University/Veterans Affairs (CWRU/VA) implanted standing neuroprosthesis with more than 12 months of experience with the functional electrical stimulation (FES) system. Nine implant recipients were using the neuroprosthesis regularly for standing and/or exercising at the time of the survey. All 11 implant recipients noted improved health and a reduced incidence of pressure sores, leg spasms, and urinary tract infections (UTIs). No incidents of deep-vein thrombosis, infection, cellulitis, or electrical burns because of the neuroprosthesis were noted. System recipients uniformly felt that the neuroprosthesis resulted in better overall health and general well-being. Subjects were moderately to very satisfied with the performance of the neuroprosthesis and unanimously expressed a willingness to repeat the surgery and rehabilitation to obtain the same clinical outcome. All implant recipients reported the system to be safe, reliable, and easy to use. The implanted standing neuroprosthesis appears to be a clinically acceptable and effective means of providing the ability to exercise, stand, and transfer to selected individuals with paraplegia or low tetraplegia.},

Tissue health was evaluated through monitoring tissue oxygen levels in the ischial region along with measuring interface pressures at the seating support interface. Baseline assessments were done at study enrollment and repeated on completion of a conditioning exercise program. Serial assessments of tissue health were performed on eight NMES implant recipients. Unloaded tissue oxygen levels in the ischial region tended to increase after following the NMES exercise program for 8 weeks. Concurrently, pressure distributions at the seating support interface tended to change such that although the total pressure acting at the interface did not change, ischial region pressures showed a significant decrease. These changes indicate that chronic use of NMES has a quantifiable benefit on tissue health.},

The initial design specifications included portability (approximately 500 g), battery-powered output, constant current control (0-300 mA), 8 channels of biphasic stimulation (charge-balanced, constant current), and microprocessor control of all stimulation parameters. Various tests, including output power characteristics, environmental, mechanical, and battery life, were performed on three prototype units to validate our design specifications. Having successfully passed all tests, the ExoStim is now ready to be deployed to clinical trial sites for further evaluation with spinal cord injured subjects.},

   abstract = {The ability for individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) to affect changes in standing posture with functional neuromuscular stimulation (FNS) was explored using an anatomically inspired musculoskeletal model of the trunk, pelvis and lower extremities (LE). The model tracked trajectories for anteriorly and laterally shifting movements away from erect stance. Forces were applied to both shoulders to represent upper extremity (UE) interaction with an assistive device (e.g., a walker). The muscle excitations required to execute shifting maneuvers with UE forces <10% body-weight (BW) were determined via dynamic optimization. Nine muscle sets were examined to maximize control of shifting posture. Inclusion of the Psoas and External Obliques bilaterally resulted in the least relative UE effort (0.119, mean UE effort = 45.3N ≡ 5.4% BW) for anterior shifting. For lateral shifting, the set including the Psoas and Latissimus Dorsi bilaterally yielded the best performance (0.025, mean UE effort = 27.8 N ≡ 3.3% BW). However, adding the Psoas alone bilaterally competed favorably in overall best performance across both maneuvers. This study suggests suitable activation to specific muscles of the trunk and LE can enable individuals with SCI to alter their standing postures with minimal upper-body effort and subsequently increase reach and standing work volume.},

Several interventions in the areas of neuroregeneration, pharmacology and rehabilitation engineering/neuroscience are currently under investigation for restoring function after SCI. In this paper, we focus on the use of neuroprosthetic devices for restoring standing and ambulation as well as improving general health and wellness after SCI. Four neuroprosthetic approaches are discussed along with their demonstrated advantages and their future needs for improved clinical applicability. We first introduce surface functional electrical stimulation (FES) devices for restoring ambulation and highlight the importance of these devices for facilitating exercise activities and systemic physiological activation. Implanted muscle-based FES devices for restoring standing and walking that are currently undergoing clinical trials are then presented. The use of implanted peripheral nerve intraneural arrays of multi-site microelectrodes for providing fine and graded control of force during sit-to-stand maneuvers is subsequently demonstrated. Finally, intraspinal microstimulation (ISMS) of the lumbosacral spinal cord for restoring standing and walking is introduced and its results to date are presented. We conclude with a general discussion of the common needs of the neuroprosthetic devices presented in this paper and the improvements that may be incorporated in the future to advance their clinical utility and user satisfaction.},

   abstract = {The objective of this study is to develop a two-dimensional dynamic model of the knee joint to simulate its response under sudden impact. The knee joint is modeled as two rigid bodies, representing a fixed femur and a moving tibia, connected by 10 nonlinear springs representing the different fibers of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments, the medial and lateral collateral ligaments, and the posterior part of the capsule. In the analysis, the joint profiles were represented by polynomials. Model equations include three nonlinear differential equations of motion and three nonlinear algebraic equations representing the geometric constraints. A single point contact was assumed to exist at all times. Numerical solutions were obtained by applying Newmark constant-average-acceleration scheme of differential approximation to transform the motion equations into a set of nonlinear simultaneous algebraic equations. The equations reduced thus to six nonlinear algebraic equations in six unknowns. The Newton-Raphson iteration technique was then used to obtain the solution. Knee response was determined under sudden rectangular pulsing posterior forces applied to the tibia and having different amplitudes and durations. The results indicate that increasing pulse amplitude and/or duration produced a decrease in the magnitude of the tibio-femoral contact force, indicating thus a reduction in the joint stiffness.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Using a Hotelling framework, we derive the open-loop solution (health care providers set the optimal investment plan at the initial period) and the feedback closed-loop solution (providers move investments in response to the dynamics of the states). Under the closed-loop solution competition is more intense in the sense that providers observe quality in each period and base their investment on this information. If the marginal provision cost is constant, the open-loop and closed-loop solutions coincide, and the results are similar to the ones obtained by static models. If the marginal provision cost is increasing, investment and quality are lower in the closed-loop solution (when competition is more intense). In this case, static models tend to exaggerate the positive effect of competition on quality.},

   abstract = {During quiet standing, humans tend to sway with a distinctive pattern that has been difficult to capture with simple engineering models. We have developed a nonlinear optimal control model for posture regulation. The proposed model consists of two main components: body dynamics and performance measure. The body dynamics are those of a double inverted pendulum in the sagittal plane controlled by ankle and hip torques. The performance measure is nonlinear quartic in the center of pressure and quadratic in the controls. Realistic values for both sensory and motor delays are included in the dynamic model. This nonlinear quartic regulator problem is solved approximately by the model predictive control technique. The resulting feedback control replicates both the experimentally observed sway and the coordinated nonlinear response. It should also use less muscular energy than other comparable controls. The method can easily be extended to more complex models of posture regulation.},

The suggested applications are for studies in the field of human movement. In the proposed EKF, the quaternion associated with the body rotation is included in the state vector together with the bias of the aiding system sensors. Moreover, in addition to the in-line procedure of sensor bias compensation, the measurement noise covariance matrix is adapted, to guard against the effects which body motion and temporary magnetic disturbance may have on the reliability of measurements of gravity and earth's magnetic field, respectively. By computer simulations and experimental validation with human hand orientation motion signals, improvements in the accuracy of orientation estimates are demonstrated for the proposed EKF, as compared with filter implementations where either the in-line calibration procedure, the adaptive mechanism for weighting the measurements of the aiding system sensors, or both are not implemented.},

   abstract = {Robotic assisted beating heart surgery aims to allow surgeons to operate on a beating heart without stabilizers as if the heart is stationary. The robot actively cancels heart motion by closely following a point of interest (POI) on the heart surface-a process called Active Relative Motion Canceling (ARMC). Due to the high bandwidth of the POI motion, it is necessary to supply the controller with an estimate of the immediate future of the POI motion over a prediction horizon in order to achieve sufficient tracking accuracy. In this paper, two least-square based prediction algorithms, using an adaptive filter to generate future position estimates, are implemented and studied. The first method assumes a linear system relation between the consecutive samples in the prediction horizon. On the contrary, the second method performs this parametrization independently for each point over the whole the horizon. The effects of predictor parameters and variations in heart rate on tracking performance are studied with constant and varying heart rate data. The predictors are evaluated using a 3 degrees of freedom test-bed and prerecorded in-vivo motion data. Then, the one-step prediction and tracking performances of the presented approaches are compared with an Extended Kalman Filter predictor. Finally, the essential features of the proposed prediction algorithms are summarized.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: High-frequency trains of electrical stimulation applied over the human muscles can generate forces higher than would be expected by direct activation of motor axons, as evidenced by an unexpected relation between the stimuli and the evoked contractions, originating what has been called "extra forces". This phenomenon has been thought to reflect nonlinear input/output neural properties such as plateau potential activation in motoneurons. However, more recent evidence has indicated that extra forces generated during electrical stimulation are mediated primarily, if not exclusively, by an intrinsic muscle property, and not from a central mechanism as previously thought. Given the inherent differences between electrical and vibratory stimuli, this study aimed to investigate: (a) whether the generation of vibration-induced muscle forces results in an unexpected relation between the stimuli and the evoked contractions (i.e. extra forces generation) and (b) whether these extra forces are accompanied by signs of a centrally-mediated mechanism or whether intrinsic muscle properties are the predominant mechanisms.

METHODS: Six subjects had their Achilles tendon stimulated by 100 Hz vibratory stimuli that linearly increased in amplitude (with a peak-to-peak displacement varying from 0 to 5 mm) for 10 seconds and then linearly decreased to zero for the next 10 seconds. As a measure of motoneuron excitability taken at different times during the vibratory stimulation, short-latency compound muscle action potentials (V/F-waves) were recorded in the soleus muscle in response to supramaximal nerve stimulation.

RESULTS: Plantar flexion torque and soleus V/F-wave amplitudes were increased in the second half of the stimulation in comparison with the first half.

CONCLUSION: The present findings provide evidence that vibratory stimuli may trigger a centrally-mediated mechanism that contributes to the generation of extra torques. The vibration-induced increased motoneuron excitability (leading to increased torque generation) presumably activates spinal motoneurons following the size principle, which is a desirable feature for stimulation paradigms involved in rehabilitation programs and exercise training.},

   abstract = {Standing balance is often threatened in everyday life. These threats typically involve scenarios in which either the likelihood or the consequence of falling is higher than normal. When cats are placed in these scenarios they respond by increasing the sensitivity of muscle spindles imbedded in the leg muscles, presumably to increase balance-relevant afferent information available to the nervous system. At present, it is unknown whether humans also respond to such postural threats by altering muscle spindle sensitivity. Here we present two studies that probed the effects of postural threat on spinal stretch reflexes. In study 1 we manipulated the threat associated with an increased consequence of a fall by having subjects stand at the edge of an elevated surface (3.2 m). In study 2 we manipulated the threat by increasing the likelihood of a fall by occasionally tilting the support surface on which subjects stood. In both scenarios we used Hoffmann (H) and tendon stretch (T) reflexes to probe the spinal stretch reflex circuit of the soleus muscle. We observed increased T-reflex amplitudes and unchanged H-reflex amplitudes in both threat scenarios. These results suggest that the synaptic state of the spinal stretch reflex is unaffected by postural threat and that therefore the muscle spindles activated in the T-reflexes must be more sensitive in the threatening conditions. We propose that this increase in sensitivity may function to satisfy the conflicting needs to restrict movement with threat, while maintaining a certain amount of sensory information related to postural control.},

The body is based on principles derived from human muscular architecture, using muscles on straps to mimic agonist/antagonist muscle action as well as bifunctional muscles. Load sensors in the straps model Golgi tendon organs. The neural architecture is a central pattern generator (CPG) composed of a half-center oscillator combined with phase-modulated reflexes that is simulated using a spiking neural network. We show that the interaction between the reflex system, body dynamics and CPG results in a walking cycle that is entrained to the dynamics of the system. We also show that the CPG helped stabilize the gait against perturbations relative to a purely reflexive system, and compared the joint trajectories to human walking data. This robot represents a complete physical, or 'neurorobotic', model of the system, demonstrating the usefulness of this type of robotics research for investigating the neurophysiological processes underlying walking in humans and animals.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Functional electrical stimulation (FES) applied via transcutaneous electrodes is a common rehabilitation technique for assisting grasp in patients with central nervous system lesions. To improve the stimulation effectiveness of conventional FES, we introduce multi-pad electrodes and a new stimulation paradigm.

METHODS: The new FES system comprises an electrode composed of small pads that can be activated individually. This electrode allows the targeting of motoneurons that activate synergistic muscles and produce a functional movement. The new stimulation paradigm allows asynchronous activation of motoneurons and provides controlled spatial distribution of the electrical charge that is delivered to the motoneurons. We developed an automated technique for the determination of the preferred electrode based on a cost function that considers the required movement of the fingers and the stabilization of the wrist joint. The data used within the cost function come from a sensorized garment that is easy to implement and does not require calibration. The design of the system also includes the possibility for fine-tuning and adaptation with a manually controllable interface.

RESULTS: The device was tested on three stroke patients. The results show that the multi-pad electrodes provide the desired level of selectivity and can be used for generating a functional grasp. The results also show that the procedure, when performed on a specific user, results in the preferred electrode configuration characteristics for that patient. The findings from this study are of importance for the application of transcutaneous stimulation in the clinical and home environments.},

   abstract = {Stereotypical locomotor movements can be made without input from the brain after a complete spinal transection. However, the restoration of functional gait requires descending modulation of spinal circuits to independently control the movement of each limb. To evaluate whether a brain-machine interface (BMI) could be used to regain conscious control over the hindlimb, rats were trained to press a pedal and the encoding of hindlimb movement was assessed using a BMI paradigm. Off-line, information encoded by neurons in the hindlimb sensorimotor cortex was assessed. Next neural population functions, or weighted representations of the neuronal activity, were used to replace the hindlimb movement as a trigger for reward in real-time (on-line decoding) in three conditions: while the animal could still press the pedal, after the pedal was removed and after a complete spinal transection. A novel representation of the motor program was learned when the animals used neural control to achieve water reward (e.g. more information was conveyed faster). After complete spinal transection, the ability of these neurons to convey information was reduced by more than 40%. However, this BMI representation was relearned over time despite a persistent reduction in the neuronal firing rate during the task. Therefore, neural control is a general feature of the motor cortex, not restricted to forelimb movements, and can be regained after spinal injury.},

Electrode arrays containing 100, 0.5-1.5-mm-long penetrating microelectrodes were inserted into the sciatic nerves of cats, and forces generated by gastrocnemius muscles in response to stimulation of the nerves were monitored via a force transducer attached to the tendons. In single-electrode stimulation, responses evoked by low-frequency [15 pulses/second, (p/s)] stimulation exhibited greater fatigue resistance than did responses evoked by higher frequency stimulation (30 and 60 p/s), but showed far more ripple within each response. We compared interleaved 15 p/s stimulation of four electrodes (100 micros biphasic pulses, 750-ms pulse trains) that produced a net stimulation frequency of 60 p/s with multielectrode 60 p/s quasi-simultaneous stimulation protocols. Across a broad range of forces (10% to 80% of maximum), responses evoked by multielectrode 15 p/s interleaved stimulation exhibited substantially less fatigue than did responses evoked by 60 p/s quasi-simultaneous stimulation, and less ripple than responses evoked by single-electrode 15 p/s stimulation.

   abstract = {The ability of an animal to detect and respond to changes in the environment is crucial to its survival. However, two elements of sensorimotor control - the time required to respond to a stimulus (responsiveness) and the precision of stimulus detection and response production (resolution) - are inherently limited by a competition for space in peripheral nerves and muscles. These limitations only become more acute as animal size increases. In this paper, we investigated whether the physiology of giraffes has found unique solutions for maintaining sensorimotor performance in order to compensate for their extreme size. To examine responsiveness, we quantified three major sources of delay: nerve conduction delay, muscle electromechanical delay and force generation delay. To examine resolution, we quantified the number and size distribution of nerve fibers in the sciatic nerve. Rather than possessing a particularly unique sensorimotor system, we found that our measurements in giraffes were broadly comparable to size-dependent trends seen across other terrestrial mammals. Consequently, both giraffes and other large animals must contend with greater sensorimotor delays and lower innervation density in comparison to smaller animals. Because of their unconventional leg length, giraffes may experience even longer delays compared with other animals of the same mass when sensing distal stimuli. While there are certainly advantages to being tall, there appear to be challenges as well - our results suggest that giraffes are less able to precisely and accurately sense and respond to stimuli using feedback alone, particularly when moving quickly.},

   abstract = {People prefer walking speeds that minimize energetic cost. This may be accomplished by directly sensing metabolic rate and adapting gait to minimize it, but only slowly due to the compounded effects of sensing delays and iterative convergence. Visual and other sensory information is available more rapidly and could help predict which gait changes reduce energetic cost, but only approximately because it relies on prior experience and an indirect means to achieve economy. We used virtual reality to manipulate visually presented speed while 10 healthy subjects freely walked on a self-paced treadmill to test whether the nervous system beneficially combines these two mechanisms. Rather than manipulating the speed of visual flow directly, we coupled it to the walking speed selected by the subject and then manipulated the ratio between these two speeds. We then quantified the dynamics of walking speed adjustments in response to perturbations of the visual speed. For step changes in visual speed, subjects responded with rapid speed adjustments (lasting <2 s) and in a direction opposite to the perturbation and consistent with returning the visually presented speed toward their preferred walking speed, when visual speed was suddenly twice (one-half) the walking speed, subjects decreased (increased) their speed. Subjects did not maintain the new speed but instead gradually returned toward the speed preferred before the perturbation (lasting >300 s). The timing and direction of these responses strongly indicate that a rapid predictive process informed by visual feedback helps select preferred speed, perhaps to complement a slower optimization process that seeks to minimize energetic cost.},

To explore the therapeutic application of these protocols, we studied the impact of down-conditioning the soleus H-reflex in people with impaired locomotion caused by chronic incomplete spinal cord injury. After a baseline period in which soleus H-reflex size was measured and locomotion was assessed, subjects completed either 30 H-reflex down-conditioning sessions (DC subjects) or 30 sessions in which the H-reflex was simply measured [unconditioned (UC) subjects], and locomotion was reassessed. Over the 30 sessions, the soleus H-reflex decreased in two-thirds of the DC subjects (a success rate similar to that in normal subjects) and remained smaller several months later. In these subjects, locomotion became faster and more symmetrical, and the modulation of EMG activity across the step cycle increased bilaterally. Furthermore, beginning about halfway through the conditioning sessions, all of these subjects commented spontaneously that they were walking faster and farther in their daily lives, and several noted less clonus, easier stepping, and/or other improvements. The H-reflex did not decrease in the other DC subjects or in any of the UC subjects; and their locomotion did not improve. These results suggest that reflex-conditioning protocols can enhance recovery of function after incomplete spinal cord injuries and possibly in other disorders as well. Because they are able to target specific spinal pathways, these protocols could be designed to address each individual's particular deficits, and might thereby complement other rehabilitation methods.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Examine the effects of asynchronously activating motor units of the human quadriceps femoris muscle during electrical stimulation.

METHODS: Two stimulation channels were used to activate the muscle. One pair of electrodes was placed over the vastus medialis (Channel 1) and another pair was placed over the vastus lateralis (Channel 2). All contractions were isometric. The stimulation frequency was 10 Hz for each channel and the effect of varying the delay between the two channels was tested.

RESULTS: Synchronous activation of both channels produced the greatest forces and stimulating the muscle 180 degrees out of phase (ie, with a 50-msec delay) produced the least forces.

CONCLUSIONS: Activating motor units asynchronously under certain conditions will be less efficient than synchronous activation. This study, therefore, helps to define the boundary conditions when asynchronous stimulation may be helpful.},

The present study is the first to report the force augmentation produced by VFTs after fatiguing the muscle with VFTs versus fatiguing the muscle with CFTs. Data were obtained from the human quadriceps femoris muscles of 12 healthy subjects. Each subject participated in three experimental sessions. Each session fatigued the muscle with one of three protocols: CFTs with 70-ms interpulse intervals (CFT70); CFTs with 55.5-ms interpulse intervals (CFT55.5); or VFTs. Following each fatiguing protocol the muscles were tested with all three stimulation patterns (i.e., CFT55.5, CFT70, and VFT). At the end of the fatiguing protocol the VFT produced force-time integrals and peak forces approximately 18% and 32% greater than the CFT70, respectively. The testing trains showed that the VFT produced approximately 25-35% greater force-time integrals than either CFT and approximately 35-47% greater peak forces than the CFT70. For each testing train, approximately 10-15% greater force-time integrals were seen when the muscles were fatigued with the CFTs than when fatigued with the VFTs. These results support suggestions that VFTs may be useful during clinical applications of electrical stimulation.},

Literature spanning more than 30 years has provided comprehensive information about the catchlike property of skeletal muscle. The pattern of the catchlike-inducing train that maximizes muscle performance is fairly similar across different muscles of different species and under various stimulation conditions.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: During functional electrical stimulation (FES), clinicians typically increase stimulation intensity to offset fatigue and maintain functional levels of force production. However, recent studies have suggested that increasing the stimulation frequency is an effective strategy for overcoming fatigue during FES. The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of 5 stimulation strategies on maintaining forces during repetitive isometric muscle activation.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The right quadriceps femoris muscles of 12 subjects with no history of lower-extremity orthopedic, neurological, or vascular problems were tested. The 5 stimulation strategies were: progressively increasing the frequency, progressively increasing the intensity, and 3 combination protocols that first increased the intensity and then increased the frequency. The only difference among the 3 combination protocols was the starting frequency used in each protocol (20, 30, or 40 Hz). For all protocols, the stimulation frequency or intensity was increased progressively every time the peak force declined more than 10% from a targeted force level. The specific step increases in frequency or intensity were customized for each subject. A contraction was defined as successful when its peak force exceeded 90% of the targeted force level.

RESULTS: The results showed that progressively increasing only the frequency produced 59% more successful contractions than progressively increasing only the intensity. In addition, the combination stimulation protocol that began with 30-Hz trains produced the most successful contractions (mean=1,205 contractions; 35%-74% more than the other 4 protocols tested).

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The results suggest that increasing the stimulation intensity and then the frequency is the best strategy to maintain muscle performance and could help clinicians design optimal stimulation protocols to use for each patient during FES.},

Recently we tested and validated such a model using able-bodied subjects. The purpose of this study was to determine whether this model applied to persons with spinal cord injuries (SCI). To this end, the isometric force responses of the paralyzed quadriceps femoris muscles of 14 adolescents and young adults were tested. For each subject, the force responses to two six-pulse stimulation trains were used to identify the parameter values of the model and then the model was used to predict the force responses to three train patterns across a range of frequencies in both a nonfatigued and fatigued condition. The intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) between the experimental and predicted force-time integrals and peak forces were above 0.90 for 12 of the 13 stimulation trains tested in the nonfatigued condition and all 13 trains tested in the fatigued condition. The success of our model with SCI subjects leads us to believe that our model may be useful for designing optimal stimulation parameters for standing and ambulation in patients who use FES.},

Functional electrical stimulation (FES) applied during fast walking (FastFES) is an effective gait rehabilitation strategy that can lead to improvements in gait performance, walking speed and endurance, balance, activity, and participation poststroke. The effect of FastFES gait training on mechanical energy utilization is not well understood. The objective of this study was to test the effects of 12 weeks of FastFES gait training on mechanical recovery indices of poststroke gait. Kinematic data were collected from 11 stroke survivors before and after 12 weeks of FastFES training. Mechanical recovery was calculated from the positive changes in vertical, anterior-posterior, and medial-lateral components of center of mass energy. The average mechanical recovery increased from 34.5% before training to 40.0% after training. The increase was statistically significant (P = 0.014). The average self-selected walking speed increased from 0.4 m/s to 0.7 m/s after the 12-week FastFES training. The results indicate that the subjects were better able to generate and utilize the external mechanical energy of walking after FastFES gait training. FastFES gait training has the capacity to increase the gait speed, improve the mechanical recovery, and reduce the mechanical energy expenditure of stroke survivors when they walk.},

   abstract = {Gait dysfunctions are highly prevalent in individuals post-stroke and affect multiple lower extremity joints. Recent evidence suggests that treadmill walking at faster than self-selected speeds can help improve post-stroke gait impairments. Also, the combination of functional electrical stimulation (FES) and treadmill training has emerged as a promising post-stroke gait rehabilitation intervention. However, the differential effects of combining FES with treadmill walking at the fast versus a slower, self-selected speed have not been compared previously. In this study, we compared the immediate effects on gait while post-stroke individuals walked on a treadmill at their self-selected speed without FES (SS), at the SS speed with FES (SS-FES), at the fastest speed they are capable of attaining (FAST), and at the FAST speed with FES (FAST-FES). During SS-FES and FAST-FES, FES was delivered to paretic ankle plantarflexors during terminal stance and to paretic dorsiflexors during swing phase. Our results showed improvements in peak anterior ground reaction force (AGRF) and trailing limb angle during walking at FAST versus SS. FAST-FES versus SS-FES resulted in greater peak AGRF, trailing limb angle, and swing phase knee flexion. FAST-FES resulted in further increase in peak AGRF compared to FAST. We posit that the enhancement of multiple aspects of post-stroke gait during FAST-FES suggest that FAST-FES may have potential as a post-stroke gait rehabilitation intervention.},

   abstract = {Mathematical models have been developed to predict fatigue during functional electrical stimulation, but the predictive accuracy at different muscle lengths is unknown. The objectives of our study were to: (1) experimentally determine the relationship between knee extension angle (20 degrees, 40 degrees, 65 degrees, and 90 degrees) and fatigue of the quadriceps muscles, and (2) predict that relationship using a mathematical model. A computer-controlled stimulator sent trains of pulses to surface electrodes on the thighs of five subjects while forces were measured at the ankle. A two-component mathematical model was developed. One component accounted for force, and the other accounted for fatigue. The model was fit to the data, and parameters were identified at 90 degrees . The fitted subject-averaged r(2) value was 0.89. The model was used to predict fatigue at the remaining angles, and the subject-averaged r(2) values were >0.75. Therefore, at least 75% of the variability in the measurements was explained by the model. The force model is explicitly dependent on angle, and the fatigue model is explicitly dependent on force; therefore, the dependence of fatigue on knee angle was implicit.},

Currently, the manner in which voluntary contractions and electrically elicited forces summate is not well understood. The objective of the present study is to develop a model that predicts the forces obtained when electrical stimulation is superimposed on a volitional contraction. Quadriceps femoris muscles of 12 able-bodied subjects were tested. Our results showed that the total force produced when electrical stimulation was superimposed during a volitional contraction could be modeled by the equation T=V+S[(MaxForce-V)/MaxForce]N, where T is the total force produced, V is the force in response to volitional contraction alone, S is the force response to the electrical stimulation alone, MaxForce is the maximum force-generating ability of the muscle, and N is a parameter that we posit depends on the differences in the motor unit recruitment order and firing rates between volitional and electrically elicited contractions. In addition, our results showed that the model predicted accurately (intraclass correlation coefficient>or=0.97) the total force in response to a wide range of stimulation intensities and frequencies superimposed on a wide range of volitional contraction levels. Thus the model will be helpful to clinicians and scientists to predict the amount of stimulation needed to produce the targeted force levels in individuals with partial paralysis.},

   abstract = {Increasing stimulation frequency has been shown to increase fatigue but not when the changes in force associated with changes in frequency have been controlled. An effect of frequency, independent of force, may be associated with the metabolic cost resulting from the additional activations. Here, two separate experiments were performed on human medial gastrocnemius muscles. The first experiment (n = 8) was designed to test the effect of the number of pulses on fatigue. The declines in force during two repetitive, 150-train stimulation protocols that produced equal initial forces, one using 80-Hz trains and the other using 100-Hz trains, were compared. Despite a difference of 600 pulses (23.5%), the protocols produced similar rates and amounts of fatigue. In the second experiment, designed to test the effect of the number of pulses on the metabolic cost of contraction, 31P-NMR spectra were collected (n = 6) during two ischemic, eight-train stimulation protocols (80- and 100-Hz) that produced comparable forces despite a difference of 320 pulses (24.8%). No differences were found in the changes in P(i) concentration, phosphocreatine concentration, and intracellular pH or in the ATP turnover produced by the two trains. These results suggest that the effect of stimulation frequency on fatigue is related to the force produced, rather than to the number of activations. In addition, within the range of frequencies tested, increasing total activations did not increase metabolic cost.},

This pa- per presents such an analysis of an inverted-pendulum human transporter. The list of hazards is constructed by using funda- mental knowledge of the dynamics and the mechanical design obtained through simulation and experimentation. However, the dynamics are so complex that the list is augmented with hazards that are revealed by searching through accident videos posted on the Internet. The severity of each hazard is estimated using an energy-based measurement of the hazard onset conditions. While this case study is interesting, it also provides a systematic ap- proach to hazard analysis that can be applied to other complex and dangerous dynamic systems.},

@inproceedings{Kwon2013,
   abstract = {Brain-computer interface (BCI) is an emerging communication technique that decodes the user's intention or emotional state. Emotional states usually affect one's brain activity, so use of such emotional states can enhance BCI performance. Emotional data may implicitly have specific informative patterns depending on stimuli such as facial expression, objects, or scenery. In this work, we analyzed 28 emotional datasets and focused particularly on the effect of the perceptual complexity of stimuli. To classify valence (emotional) states and perceptual complexity, we used multidimensional features consisting of the temporal, spatial, and spectral domains. Among them, significantly informative features were extracted by multivariate and univariate analyses. We found that, although the multivariate feature extraction performed valence classification comparable to the univariate one, it was notably more accurate in the classification of perceptual complexity. © 2013 IEEE.},

@article{Park2013b,
   abstract = {The unpredictability of re-occurring seizures dramatically impacts the quality of life and autonomy of people with epilepsy. Reliable early seizure detection could open new therapeutic possibilities and thus substantially improve quality of life and autonomy. Though many seizure detection studies have shown the potential of scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) and intracranial EEG (iEEG) signals, reliable early detection of human seizures remains elusive in practice. Here, we examined the use of intracortical local field potentials (LFPs) recorded from 4×4-mm(2) 96-microelectrode arrays (MEA) for early detection of human epileptic seizures. We adopted a framework consisting of (1) sampling of intracortical LFPs; (2) denoising of LFPs with the Kalman filter; (3) spectral power estimation in specific frequency bands using 1-sec moving time windows; (4) extraction of statistical features, such as the mean, variance, and Fano factor (calculated across channels) of the power in each frequency band; and (5) cost-sensitive support vector machine (SVM) classification of ictal and interictal samples. We tested the framework in one-participant dataset, including 4 seizures and corresponding interictal recordings preceding each seizure. The participant was a 52-year-old woman suffering from complex partial seizures. LFPs were recorded from an MEA implanted in the participant's left middle temporal gyrus. In this participant, spectral power in 0.3-10 Hz, 20-55 Hz, and 125-250 Hz changed significantly between ictal and interictal epochs. The examined seizure detection framework provided an event-wise sensitivity of 100% (4/4) and only one 20-sec-long false positive event in interictal recordings (likely an undetected subclinical event under further visual inspection), and a detection latency of 4.35 ± 2.21 sec (mean ± std) with respect to iEEG-identified seizure onsets. These preliminary results indicate that intracortical MEA recordings may provide key signals to quickly and reliably detect human seizures.},

   abstract = {Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common sleep disorder that causes increasing risk of mortality and affects quality of life of approximately 6.62% of the total US population. Timely detection of sleep apnea events is vital for the treatment of OSA. In this paper, we present a novel approach based on extracting the quantifiers of nonlinear dynamic cardio-respiratory coupling from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals to detect sleep apnea events. The quantifiers of the cardio-respiratory dynamic coupling were extracted based on recurrence quantification analysis (RQA), and a battery of statistical data mining techniques were to enhance OSA detection accuracy. This approach would lead to a cost-effective and convenient means for screening of OSA, compared to traditional polysomnography (PSG) methods. The results of tests conducted using data from PhysioNets Sleep Apnea database suggest excellent quality of the OSA detection based on a thorough comparison of multiple models, using model selection criteria of validation data: Sensitivity (91.93%), Specificity (85.84%), Misclassification (11.94%) and Lift (2.7).},

   abstract = {Mindfulness meditation (MM) is an inward mental practice, in which a resting but alert state of mind is maintained. MM intervention was performed for a population of older people with high stress levels. This study assessed signal processing methodologies of electroencephalographic (EEG) and respiration signals during meditation and control condition to aid in quantification of the meditative state. EEG and respiration data were collected and analyzed on 34 novice meditators after a 6-week meditation intervention. Collected data were analyzed with spectral analysis and support vector machine classification to evaluate an objective marker for meditation. We observed meditation and control condition differences in the alpha, beta and theta frequency bands. Furthermore, we established a classifier using EEG and respiration signals with a higher accuracy at discriminating between meditation and control conditions than one using the EEG signal only. EEG and respiration based classifier is a viable objective marker for meditation ability. Future studies should quantify different levels of meditation depth and meditation experience using this classifier. Development of an objective physiological meditation marker will allow the mind-body medicine field to advance by strengthening rigor of methods.},

   abstract = {Tracking spectral changes in neural signals, such as local field potentials (LFPs) and scalp or intracranial electroencephalograms (EEG, iEEG), is an important problem in early detection and prediction of seizures. Most approaches have focused on either parametric or nonparametric spectral estimation methods based on moving time windows. Here, we explore an adaptive (time-varying) parametric ARMA approach for tracking spectral changes in neural signals based on the fixed-interval Kalman smoother. We apply the method to seizure detection based on spectral features of intracortical LFPs recorded from a person with pharmacologically intractable focal epilepsy. We also devise and test an approach for real-time tracking of spectra based on the adaptive parametric method with the fixed-interval Kalman smoother. The order of ARMA models is determined via the AIC computed in moving time windows. We quantitatively demonstrate the advantages of using the adaptive parametric estimation method in seizure detection over nonparametric alternatives based exclusively on moving time windows. Overall, the adaptive parametric approach significantly improves the statistical separability of interictal and ictal epochs.},

   abstract = {Disorders of the human neuromusculoskeletal system such as osteoarthritis, stroke, cerebral palsy, and paraplegia significantly affect mobility and result in a decreased quality of life. Surgical and rehabilitation treatment planning for these disorders is based primarily on static anatomic measurements and dynamic functional measurements filtered through clinical experience. While this subjective treatment planning approach works well in many cases, it does not predict accurate functional outcome in many others. This paper presents a vision for how patient-specific multibody dynamic models can serve as the foundation for an objective treatment planning approach that identifies optimal treatments and treatment parameters on an individual patient basis. First, a computational paradigm is presented for constructing patient-specific multibody dynamic models. This paradigm involves a combination of patient-specific skeletal models, muscle-tendon models, neural control models, and articular contact models, with the complexity of the complete model being dictated by the requirements of the clinical problem being addressed. Next, three clinical applications are presented to illustrate how such models could be used in the treatment design process. One application involves the design of patient-specific gait modification strategies for knee osteoarthritis rehabilitation, a second involves the selection of optimal patient-specific surgical parameters for a particular knee osteoarthritis surgery, and the third involves the design of patient-specific muscle stimulation patterns for stroke rehabilitation. The paper concludes by discussing important challenges that need to be overcome to turn this vision into reality.},

   abstract = {Cocontraction (the simultaneous activation of antagonist muscles around a joint) provides the nervous system with a way to adapt the mechanical properties of the limb to changing task requirements-both in statics and during movement. However, relatively little is known about the conditions under which the motor system modulates limb impedance through cocontraction. The goal of this study was to test for a possible relationship between cocontraction and movement accuracy in multi-joint limb movements. The electromyographic activity of seven single- and double-joint shoulder and elbow muscles was recorded using surface electrodes while subjects performed a pointing task in a horizontal plane to targets that varied randomly in size. Movement speed was controlled by providing subjects with feedback on a trial-to-trial basis. Measures of cocontraction were estimated both during movement and during a 200-ms window immediately following movement end. We observed an inverse relationship between target size and cocontraction: as target size was reduced, cocontraction activity increased. In addition, trajectory variability decreased and endpoint accuracy improved. This suggests that, although energetically expensive, cocontraction may be a strategy used by the motor system to facilitate multi-joint arm movement accuracy. We also observed a general trend for cocontraction levels to decrease over time, supporting the idea that cocontraction and associated limb stiffness are reduced over the course of practice.},

In particular, muscle synergies during grasping and in graded-force tasks are of great interest for the control of dexterous hand prostheses. To this end, we have designed and tested a novel device to accurately and simultaneously measure fingertip forces. The device, called FFLS (Finger-Force Linear Sensor), measures the forces applied by the human fingertips in both directions (flexion and extension of index, middle, ring and little finger plus thumb rotation and abduction/adduction). It is suited for several different hand sizes, enforces high accuracy in the measurement and its signal is guaranteed to be linear in a high range of forces (100N in both directions for each finger). It outputs six analog voltages (±10V), suited for processing with a DAQ card.},

   abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to report the cardiopulmonary stresses (as indicated by heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen consumption and task cost) for a tetraplegic individual when walking with electrical stimulation and a gait orthosis as opposed to walking with a gait orthosis alone. Functional electrical stimulation (FES), when interfaced with a reciprocating gait orthosis (RGO), resulted in walking exercise for a C-7 level tetraplegic subject, who was 8 years post-injury. Cardiopulmonary measurements were made and task costs calculated on this individual during progressive velocity walking with the FES-RGO and the orthosis alone (without FES). Results for the tetraplegic individual indicate that there were no significant changes in heart rate at the various walking velocities with respect to the two systems. However, systolic blood pressure was significantly reduced at the three highest walking velocities (1.2, 1.6 and 2.0 kph) when using the FES and orthosis system as compared to orthosis-alone walking (p less than .025, p less than .005 and p less than .025 respectively). Calculated oxygen consumption was significantly reduced and calculated task cost improved at the highest walking velocity (2.0 kph) when using the FES-RGO system as compared to using only the RGO (p less than .025). It is concluded that cardiopulmonary stresses are significantly less for this tetraplegic individual when ambulating at the higher velocities with electrical stimulation and a gait orthosis than when walking with a gait orthosis alone. This may result in improved endurance during each walking session and (consequently) an improved aerobic exercise effect. This might also allow some tetraplegics, who would be unable to walk with the RGO alone, to walk with electrical stimulation and the RGO.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the longitudinal performance of a surgically implanted neuroprosthesis for lower-extremity exercise, standing, and transfers after spinal cord injury. DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: Research or outpatient physical therapy departments of 4 academic hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Subjects (N=15) with thoracic or low cervical level spinal cord injuries who had received the 8-channel neuroprosthesis for exercise and standing. INTERVENTION: After completing rehabilitation with the device, the subjects were discharged to unrestricted home use of the system. A series of assessments were performed before discharge and at a follow-up appointment approximately 1 year later. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Neuroprosthesis usage, maximum standing time, body weight support, knee strength, knee fatigue index, electrode stability, and component survivability. RESULTS: Levels of maximum standing time, body weight support, knee strength, and knee fatigue index were not statistically different from discharge to follow-up (P>.05). Additionally, neuroprosthesis usage was consistent with subjects choosing to use the system on approximately half of the days during each monitoring period. Although the number of hours using the neuroprosthesis remained constant, subjects shifted their usage to more functional standing versus more maintenance exercise, suggesting that the subjects incorporated the neuroprosthesis into their lives. Safety and reliability of the system were demonstrated by electrode stability and a high component survivability rate (>90%). CONCLUSIONS: This group of 15 subjects is the largest cohort of implanted lower-extremity neuroprosthetic exercise and standing system users. The safety and efficiency data from this group, and acceptance of the neuroprosthesis as demonstrated by continued usage, indicate that future efforts toward commercialization of a similar device may be warranted.},

   abstract = {The restoration of motor functions of patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) is one of important subjects for study. For this purpose, methods of functional neuromuscular stimulation (FNS) have been investigated in medical science and practice during these three decades. However, we have not achieved complete restoration of motor functions in SCI patients. On the other hand, we have achieved useful devices in human-scaled transportation by using power assist technology. Thus, applying power assist technology to the problem of restoring motor functions is one of possible solutions and sounds practical. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid system to combine power assist technology and FNS for restoring motor functions of lower extremity in SCI patients. Both powered orthosis and FNS are used to generate and control the joints moments of lower extremity in the proposed hybrid system. The main role of powered orthosis to compensate the joints moments generated by FNS and to enhance the controllability of FNS with the actuators. The proposed hybrid control system has been experimentally evaluated in gait motions by measuring the angle trajectories and generated moments around the knee and hip joints in the cases when only actuators are used and both FNS and actuators of the orthosis are used. The results prove that the control method for the hybrid system is useful to restore motor functions of lower extremity in SCI patients.},

The model was tested both with and without inertial loads placed around the ankle joints of healthy subjects. Results showed that the model predicted the knee extensions with a RMS angle error that was generally <or=8 degrees. The coefficients of determination between the measured and predicted data showed the model accounted for approximately 71%, approximately 94%, approximately 73%, and approximately 89% of the variances in the experimental maximum excursion, time to maximum excursion, maximum shortening velocity, and time to maximum shortening velocity, respectively. This study showed that our general non-isometric model predicted the lower limb motion in response to a range of stimulation frequencies and patterns, and external loads. This model can be implemented in an algorithm for controlling the position of the lower leg during the swing phase of gait during functional electrical stimulation.},

   abstract = {Gait rehabilitation robots are of increasing importance in neurorehabilitation. Conventional devices are often criticized because they are limited to reproducing predefined movement patterns. Research on patient-cooperative control strategies aims at improving robotic behavior. Robots should support patients only as much as needed and stimulate them to produce maximal voluntary efforts. This paper presents a patient-cooperative strategy that allows patients to influence the timing of their leg movements along a physiologically meaningful path. In this "path control" strategy, compliant virtual walls keep the patient's legs within a "tunnel" around the desired spatial path. Additional supportive torques enable patients to move along the path with reduced effort. Graphical feedback provides visual training instructions. The path control strategy was evaluated with 10 healthy subjects and 15 subjects with incomplete spinal cord injury. The spatio-temporal characteristics of recorded kinematic data showed that subjects walked with larger temporal variability with the new strategy. Electromyographic data indicated that subjects were training more actively. A majority of iSCI subjects was able to actively control their gait timing. Thus, the strategy allows patients to train walking while being helped rather than controlled by the robot.},

   abstract = {Motion control of musculoskeletal systems for functional electrical stimulation (FES) is a challenging problem due to the inherent complexity of the systems. These include being highly nonlinear, strongly coupled, time-varying, time-delayed, and redundant. The redundancy in particular makes it difficult to find an inverse model of the system for control purposes. We have developed a control system for multiple input multiple output (MIMO) redundant musculoskeletal systems with little prior information. The proposed method separates the steady-state properties from the dynamic properties. The dynamic control uses a steady-state inverse model and is implemented with both a PID controller for disturbance rejection and an artificial neural network (ANN) feedforward controller for fast trajectory tracking. A mechanism to control the sum of the muscle excitation levels is also included. To test the performance of the proposed control system, a two degree of freedom ankle-subtalar joint model with eight muscles was used. The simulation results show that separation of steady-state and dynamic control allow small output tracking errors for different reference trajectories such as pseudo-step, sinusoidal and filtered random signals. The proposed control method also demonstrated robustness against system parameter and controller parameter variations. A possible application of this control algorithm is FES control using multiple contact cuff electrodes where mathematical modeling is not feasible and the redundancy makes the control of dynamic movement difficult.},

Particularly, we present the experimental results obtained with the new automatic control method, designed to achieve position tracking between a user and the remote manipulator device. The major advantage of the controller is its ability to compensate for the electromechanical delay (EMD) during an FES and the communication delay (CD) due to a remote actuation. Another advantage of the developed FES controller is that only the error state and delay knowledge are required to elicit desired muscle contractions, i.e., the control implementation does not depend on model knowledge of highly nonlinear and time-varying muscle dynamics. The experimental results show its superior performance in comparison to the proportional integral derivative (PID) controller. The control performance of the PID controller and the new controller were tested for different values of a composite delay (EMD + CD).},

The orthosis is a long-leg brace that contains controllable friction brakes at both hip and knee joints. The system achieves desirable limb trajectories by utilizing the stimulated muscles as a source of unregulated power and regulating the power at each joint by computer control of the friction brakes. Muscle fatigue is reduced by locking the controllable brakes to provide the isometric joint torques necessary during stance. The hybrid gait system was evaluated and compared to conventional four channel FES-aided gait using four subjects with paraplegia. The results demonstrated significant reduction in muscle fatigue and improvement in trajectory control when using the orthosis combined with FES compared to using FES alone. Results for distance and speed improvements varied across subjects. Considerable work remains in the design of the hardware before the system is feasible for use outside the laboratory.},

However, while rebounding legs well explain the stance dynamics of running, stiff legs cannot reproduce that of walking. With a simple bipedal spring-mass model, we show that not stiff but compliant legs are essential to obtain the basic walking mechanics; incorporating the double support as an essential part of the walking motion, the model reproduces the characteristic stance dynamics that result in the observed small vertical oscillation of the body and the observed out-of-phase changes in forward kinetic and gravitational potential energies. Exploring the parameter space of this model, we further show that it not only combines the basic dynamics of walking and running in one mechanical system, but also reveals these gaits to be just two out of the many solutions to legged locomotion offered by compliant leg behaviour and accessed by energy or speed.},

Furthermore, it is proved that the closed-loop system is input-to-state stable with relation to the uncertainties. Therefore, the closed-loop system evolves towards a compact set where it is ultimately bounded. In case of decaying uncertainties, the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable. The convergence of the closed loop system is guaranteed despite the suboptimality of the solution.},

Control design methods based on the MPC concept have found wide acceptance in industrial applications and have been studied by academia. The reason for such popularity is the ability of MPC designs to yield high performance control systems capable of operating without expert intervention for long periods of time. In this paper the issues of importance that any control system should address are stated. MPC techniques are then reviewed in the light of these issues in order to point out their advantages in design and implementation. A number of design techniques emanating from MPC, namely Dynamic Matrix Control, Model Algorithmic Control, Inferential Control and Internal Model Control, are put in perspective with respect to each other and the relation to more traditional methods like Linear Quadratic Control is examined. The flexible constraint handling capabilities of MPC are shown to be a significant advantage in the context of the overall operating objectives of the process industries and the 1-, 2-, and ∞-norm formulations of the performance objective are discussed. The application of MPC to non-linear systems is examined and it is shown that its main attractions carry over. Finally, it is explained that though MPC is not inherently more or less robust than classical feedback, it can be adjusted more easily for robustness.},

Centralized MPC is largely viewed as impractical, inflexible and unsuitable for control of large, networked systems. Incorporation of the proposed distributed regulator provides a means of achieving optimal systemwide control performance (centralized) while essentially operating in a decentralized manner. The distributed regulators work iteratively and cooperatively towards achieving a common, systemwide control objective. An attractive attribute of the proposed MPC algorithm is that all intermediate iterates are feasible and the resulting distributed MPC controllers stabilize the nominal closed-loop system. These two features allow the practitioner to terminate the distributed control algorithm at the end of each sampling interval, even if convergence is not attained. Distributed MPC with output feedback is addressed using the well established Kalman filtering framework for state estimation.},

   abstract = {This paper presents a Learning-based Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (LB-NMPC) algorithm for an au- tonomous mobile robot to reduce path-tracking errors over repeated traverses along a reference path. The LB-NMPC algorithm uses a simple a priori vehicle model and a learned disturbance model. Disturbances are modelled as a Gaussian Process (GP) based on experience collected during previous traversals as a function of system state, input and other relevant variables. Modelling the disturbance as a GP enables interpolation and extrapolation of learned disturbances, a key feature of this algorithm. Localization for the controller is provided by an on-board, vision-based mapping and navigation system enabling operation in large-scale, GPS-denied environ- ments. The paper presents experimental results including over 1.8 km of travel by a four-wheeled, 50 kg robot travelling through challenging terrain (including steep, uneven hills) and by a six-wheeled, 160 kg robot learning disturbances caused by unmodelled dynamics at speeds ranging from 0.35 m/s to 1.0 m/s. The speed is scheduled to balance trial time, path- tracking errors, and localization reliability based on previous experience. The results show that the system can start from a generic a priori vehicle model and subsequently learn to reduce vehicle- and trajectory-specific path-tracking errors based on experience. I.},

   abstract = {Computation of an analytical control solution for functional electrical stimulation (FES) and orthosis-based walking is a daunting task due to the inherent nonlinear structure of the human muscle and walking dynamics. Furthermore, since muscle fatigue and available muscle force are major limiting issues, we explored the domains of numerical optimal control methods to address these issues. We first focused on the development of simple models to represent walking movement. These models account for walking produced via a limited number of activated muscles using FES along with a novel orthosis, and an assistive device such as a walker. Using dynamic optimization, the lower limb joint angle trajectories and control inputs were computed by minimizing the cost function comprising muscle stimulation variables and forces required to push a walker. Computer simulations for optimizations were performed across a range of step lengths to find the optimal step length (minimum cost per distance). Then, the optimal steady-state initial angular velocity (for optimal step length) was computed from a range of angular velocities of the lower-limb segments. We found considerable differences between able-bodied walking trajectories and the optimal walking trajectories for FES and orthosis-based walking. Based on this computer simulation study, we recommend that instead of arbitrary selection of stimulation profiles or gait parameters, dynamic optimization can be utilized to compute gait parameters such as step length, steady state velocity, and joint angle trajectories in future clinical implementation of FES and orthosis-based walking.},

   abstract = {Hybrid zero dynamics extends the Byrnes-Isidori notion of zero dynamics to a class of hybrid models called systems with impulse effects. Specifically, given a smooth submanifold that is contained in the zero set of an output function and is invariant under both the continuous flow of the system with impulse effects as well as its reset map, the restriction dynamics is called the hybrid zero dynamics. Prior results on the stabilization of periodic orbits of the hybrid zero dynamics have relied on input-output linearization of the transverse variables. The principal result of this paper shows how control Lyapunov functions can be used to exponentially stabilize periodic orbits of the hybrid zero dynamics, thereby significantly extending the class of stabilizing controllers. An illustration of this result on a model of a bipedal walking robot is provided.},

A new Robust Model Predictive Control (RMPC) algorithm based on polyhedral techniques that checks the attainability of a state space region is presented. The developed approach computes in its first stage the maximal set in the state space from which states can be driven to the target region while taking into account the system’s uncertainties. Thereafter, a RMPC algorithm that guarantees to drive the system states from the maximal set to the target region is proposed. The proposed algorithm not only gives a simple and fast sub-optimal solution which considerably reduces the online computation, it guarantees the feasibility and the stability of the solution. The proposed algorithms are applied in simulation to a two-tank example.},

   abstract = {Over the last 20 years, heart rate monitors (HRMs) have become a widely used training aid for a variety of sports. The development of new HRMs has also evolved rapidly during the last two decades. In addition to heart rate (HR) responses to exercise, research has recently focused more on heart rate variability (HRV). Increased HRV has been associated with lower mortality rate and is affected by both age and sex. During graded exercise, the majority of studies show that HRV decreases progressively up to moderate intensities, after which it stabilises. There is abundant evidence from cross-sectional studies that trained individuals have higher HRV than untrained individuals. The results from longitudinal studies are equivocal, with some showing increased HRV after training but an equal number of studies showing no differences. The duration of the training programmes might be one of the factors responsible for the versatility of the results.HRMs are mainly used to determine the exercise intensity of a training session or race. Compared with other indications of exercise intensity, HR is easy to monitor, is relatively cheap and can be used in most situations. In addition, HR and HRV could potentially play a role in the prevention and detection of overtraining. The effects of overreaching on submaximal HR are controversial, with some studies showing decreased rates and others no difference. Maximal HR appears to be decreased in almost all 'overreaching' studies. So far, only few studies have investigated HRV changes after a period of intensified training and no firm conclusions can be drawn from these results. The relationship between HR and oxygen uptake (VO(2)) has been used to predict maximal oxygen uptake (VO(2max)). This method relies upon several assumptions and it has been shown that the results can deviate up to 20% from the true value. The HR-VO(2) relationship is also used to estimate energy expenditure during field conditions. There appears to be general consensus that this method provides a satisfactory estimate of energy expenditure on a group level, but is not very accurate for individual estimations. The relationship between HR and other parameters used to predict and monitor an individual's training status can be influenced by numerous factors. There appears to be a small day-to-day variability in HR and a steady increase during exercise has been observed in most studies. Furthermore, factors such as dehydration and ambient temperature can have a profound effect on the HR-VO(2) relationship.},

A feasible dual-mode control scheme is presented in the paper, sliding mode predictive controller is implemented while the system state is outside the terminal region, besides sliding mode variable structure control designed off-line is used. The resulting control scheme has strong points of the two control methods. By predicting the pre-designed switching function, the predictive control sequence can be found by solving constrained open-loop optimal control problem, and the current control is implemented. At next sampling time the optimizing procedure is repeated. By constraining terminal sliding mode with an inequality, the state is steered into the predesigned sliding mode region, then the closed-loop stability is proved, and furthermore the system performance is analyzed. With some conditions, the method can be extended to a quasi-infinite horizon formulation. Simulation results show that less calculation is needed},

   abstract = {Rehabilitation robots have been explored for training of patients with impaired neural functions or for assistance to those with weak limbs. In recent years, the authors have proposed light-weight exoskeleton designs for the upper arm, where rigid links of the exoskeleton are replaced by lightweight cuffs attached to the moving limb segments of the human arm. Cables, driven by motors, are routed through these cuffs to move the limb segments. Previously, the authors have demonstrated via experiments that it is possible to apply "assist-as-needed" forces in all directions at the end-effector with such an exoskeleton acting on an anthropomorphic machine arm. A human-exoskeleton interface was also presented in previous works to show the feasibility of CAREX on human subjects. The goals of this paper are to (i) further address these issues when CAREX is mounted on human subjects, e.g., generation of continuous cable tension trajectories as well as estimation of the motion of glenohumeral joint rotation center; (ii) demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of CAREX on training of movements of healthy human subjects and a stroke patient. In this research, CAREX is rigidly attached to an arm orthosis worn by human subjects. The cable routing points are optimized to achieve a relatively large "tensioned" static workspace. A new cable tension planner based on optimization of a "quadratic function" is used to generate continuous cable tension trajectory to facilitate smooth motions of the arm over the workspace. Experiments were first carried out on eight healthy subjects. These experiment results show that CAREX can help the subjects move closer to a prescribed circular path during training with the force fields applied by the exoskeleton. The subjects also adapt to the path shortly after training. CAREX was also evaluated on a stroke patient to test feasibility of its use on neually impaired patients. The results show that the subject was able to move closer to a straight line path with the "assist-as-needed" force field.},

   abstract = {In this paper, the neural-network-based robust optimal control design for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems via adaptive dynamic programming approach is investigated. First, the robust controller of the original uncertain system is derived by adding a feedback gain to the optimal controller of the nominal system. It is also shown that this robust controller can achieve optimality under a specified cost function, which serves as the basic idea of the robust optimal control design. Then, a critic network is constructed to solve the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation corresponding to the nominal system, where an additional stabilizing term is introduced to verify the stability. The uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop system is also proved by using the Lyapunov approach. Moreover, the obtained results are extended to solve decentralized optimal control problem of continuous-time nonlinear interconnected large-scale systems. Finally, two simulation examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the established control scheme.},

   abstract = {Locomotion in a complex environment is often not steady, but the mechanisms used by animals to power and control unsteady locomotion (stability and maneuverability) are not well understood. We use behavioral, morphological, and impulsive perturbations to determine the compensations used during unsteady locomotion. At the level both of the whole-body and of joints, quasi-stiffness models are useful for describing adjustments to the functioning of legs and joints during maneuvers. However, alterations to the mechanics of legs and joints often are distinct for different phases of the step cycle or for specific joints. For example, negotiating steps involves independent changes of leg stiffness during compression and thrust phases of stance. Unsteady locomotion also involves parameters that are not part of the simplest reduced-parameter models of locomotion (e.g., the spring-loaded inverted pendulum) such as moments of the hip joint. Extensive coupling among translational and rotational parameters must be taken into account to stabilize locomotion or maneuver. For example, maneuvers with morphological perturbations (increased rotational inertial turns) involve changes to several aspects of movement, including the initial conditions of rotation and ground-reaction forces. Coupled changes to several parameters may be employed to control maneuvers on a trial-by-trial basis. Compensating for increased rotational inertia of the body during turns is facilitated by the opposing effects of several mechanical and behavioral parameters. However, the specific rules used by animals to control translation and rotation of the body to maintain stability or maneuver have not been fully characterized. We initiated direct-perturbation experiments to investigate the strategies used by humans to maintain stability following center-of-mass (COM) perturbations. When walking, humans showed more resistance to medio-lateral perturbations (lower COM displacement). However, when running, humans could recover from the point of maximum COM displacement faster than when walking. Consequently, the total time necessary for recovery was not significantly different between walking and running. Future experiments will determine the mechanisms used for compensations during unsteady locomotion at the behavioral, joint, and muscle levels. Using reduced-parameter models will allow common experimental and analytical frameworks for the study of both stability and maneuverability and the determination of general control strategies for unsteady locomotion.},

Of course, the output controlled by the CNS might not be exclusive but instead multiple outputs might be controlled in parallel or hierarchically. In this review we examine one particular hypothesized level of control: that the CNS produces movement through the flexible combination of groups of muscles, or muscle synergies. Several recent studies have examined this hypothesis, providing evidence both in support and in opposition to it. We discuss these results and the current state of the muscle synergy hypothesis.},

   abstract = {Muscle synergies, i.e., invariant coordinated activations of groups of muscles, have been proposed as building blocks that the central nervous system (CNS) uses to construct the patterns of muscle activity utilized for executing movements. Several efficient dimensionality reduction algorithms that extract putative synergies from electromyographic (EMG) signals have been developed. Typically, the quality of synergy decompositions is assessed by computing the Variance Accounted For (VAF). Yet, little is known about the extent to which the combination of those synergies encodes task-discriminating variations of muscle activity in individual trials. To address this question, here we conceive and develop a novel computational framework to evaluate muscle synergy decompositions in task space. Unlike previous methods considering the total variance of muscle patterns (VAF based metrics), our approach focuses on variance discriminating execution of different tasks. The procedure is based on single-trial task decoding from muscle synergy activation features. The task decoding based metric evaluates quantitatively the mapping between synergy recruitment and task identification and automatically determines the minimal number of synergies that captures all the task-discriminating variability in the synergy activations. In this paper, we first validate the method on plausibly simulated EMG datasets. We then show that it can be applied to different types of muscle synergy decomposition and illustrate its applicability to real data by using it for the analysis of EMG recordings during an arm pointing task. We find that time-varying and synchronous synergies with similar number of parameters are equally efficient in task decoding, suggesting that in this experimental paradigm they are equally valid representations of muscle synergies. Overall, these findings stress the effectiveness of the decoding metric in systematically assessing muscle synergy decompositions in task space.},

   abstract = {Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) solves the following problem: find nonnegative matrices A∈R+M×R and X∈R+R×T such that Y≅AX, given only Y∈RM×T and the assigned index R. This method has found a wide spectrum of applications in signal and image processing, such as blind source separation (BSS), spectra recovering, pattern recognition, segmentation or clustering. Such a factorization is usually performed with an alternating gradient descent technique that is applied to the squared Euclidean distance or Kullback–Leibler divergence. This approach has been used in the widely known Lee–Seung NMF algorithms that belong to a class of multiplicative iterative algorithms. It is well known that these algorithms, in spite of their low complexity, are slowly convergent, give only a strictly positive solution, and can easily fall into local minima of a nonconvex cost function. In this paper, we propose to take advantage of the second-order terms of a cost function to overcome the disadvantages of gradient (multiplicative) algorithms. First, a projected quasi-Newton method is presented, where a regularized Hessian with the Levenberg–Marquardt approach is inverted with the Q-less QR decomposition. Since the matrices A and/or X are usually sparse, a more sophisticated hybrid approach based on the gradient projection conjugate gradient (GPCG) algorithm, which was invented by More and Toraldo, is adapted for NMF. The gradient projection (GP) method is exploited to find zero-value components (active), and then the Newton steps are taken only to compute positive components (inactive) with the conjugate gradient (CG) method. As a cost function, we used the α-divergence that unifies many well-known cost functions. We applied our new NMF method to a BSS problem with mixed signals and images. The results demonstrate the high robustness of our method.},

The first stage is to extract synergies from rapid movement tasks using singular value decomposition (SVD).

The many degrees of freedom of the musculoskeletal apparatus provide great flexibility but make the control problem extremely complex. Muscle synergies--coherent activations, in space or time, of a group of muscles--have been proposed as building blocks that could simplify the construction of motor behaviors. To evaluate this hypothesis, we developed a new method to extract invariant spatiotemporal components from the simultaneous recordings of the activity of many muscles. We used this technique to analyze the muscle patterns of intact and unrestrained frogs during kicking, a natural defensive behavior. Here we show that combinations of three time-varying muscle synergies underlie the variety of muscle patterns required to kick in different directions, that the recruitment of these synergies is related to movement kinematics, and that there are similarities among the synergies extracted from different behaviors.},

   abstract = {Postural control is a natural behavior that requires the spatial and temporal coordination of multiple muscles. Complex muscle activation patterns characterizing postural responses suggest the need for independent muscle control. However, our previous work shows that postural responses in cats can be robustly reproduced by the activation of a few muscle synergies. We now investigate whether a similar neural strategy is used for human postural control. We hypothesized that a few muscle synergies could account for the intertrial variability in automatic postural responses from different perturbation directions, as well as different postural strategies. Postural responses to multidirectional support-surface translations in 16 muscles of the lower back and leg were analyzed in nine healthy subjects. Six or fewer muscle synergies were required to reproduce the postural responses of each subject. The composition and temporal activation of several muscle synergies identified across all subjects were consistent with the previously identified "ankle" and "hip" strategies in human postural responses. Moreover, intertrial variability in muscle activation patterns was successfully reproduced by modulating the activity of the various muscle synergies. This suggests that trial-to-trial variations in the activation of individual muscles are correlated and, moreover, represent variations in the amplitude of descending neural commands that activate individual muscle synergies. Finally, composition and temporal activation of most of the muscle synergies were similar across subjects. These results suggest that muscle synergies represent a general neural strategy underlying muscle coordination in postural tasks.},

   abstract = {Several recent studies have used matrix factorization algorithms to assess the hypothesis that behaviors might be produced through the combination of a small number of muscle synergies. Although generally agreeing in their basic conclusions, these studies have used a range of different algorithms, making their interpretation and integration difficult. We therefore compared the performance of these different algorithms on both simulated and experimental data sets. We focused on the ability of these algorithms to identify the set of synergies underlying a data set. All data sets consisted of nonnegative values, reflecting the nonnegative data of muscle activation patterns. We found that the performance of principal component analysis (PCA) was generally lower than that of the other algorithms in identifying muscle synergies. Factor analysis (FA) with varimax rotation was better than PCA, and was generally at the same levels as independent component analysis (ICA) and nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). ICA performed very well on data sets corrupted by constant variance Gaussian noise, but was impaired on data sets with signal-dependent noise and when synergy activation coefficients were correlated. Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) performed similarly to ICA and FA on data sets with signal-dependent noise and was generally robust across data sets. The best algorithms were ICA applied to the subspace defined by PCA (ICAPCA) and a version of probabilistic ICA with nonnegativity constraints (pICA). We also evaluated some commonly used criteria to identify the number of synergies underlying a data set, finding that only likelihood ratios based on factor analysis identified the correct number of synergies for data sets with signal-dependent noise in some cases. We then proposed an ad hoc procedure, finding that it was able to identify the correct number in a larger number of cases. Finally, we applied these methods to an experimentally obtained data set. The best performing algorithms (FA, ICA, NMF, ICAPCA, pICA) identified synergies very similar to one another. Based on these results, we discuss guidelines for using factorization algorithms to analyze muscle activation patterns. More generally, the ability of several algorithms to identify the correct muscle synergies and activation coefficients in simulated data, combined with their consistency when applied to physiological data sets, suggests that the muscle synergies found by a particular algorithm are not an artifact of that algorithm, but reflect basic aspects of the organization of muscle activation patterns underlying behaviors.},

   abstract = {Extending the concept of solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) optimization equation backwards [2], the so called converse constrained optimal control problem is introduced, and used to create various classes of nonlinear systems for which the optimal controller subject to constraints is known. In this way a systematic method for the testing, validation and comparison of different control techniques with the optimal is established. Because it naturally and explicitly handles constraints, particularly control input saturation, model predictive control (MPC) is a potentially powerful approach for nonlinear control design. However, nonconvexity of the nonlinear programs (NLP) involved in the MPC optimization makes the solution problematic. In order to explore properties of MPC-based constrained control schemes, and to point out the potential issues in implementing MPC, challenging benchmark examples are generated and analyzed. Properties of MPC-based constrained techniques are then evaluated and implementation issues are explored by applying both nonlinear MPC and MPC with feedback linearization.},

A state-feedback MPC law is computed by minimizing an upper bound of infinite horizon performance objective, which is formulated as a convex optimization involving linear matrix inequalities constraints. Time-varying linear dynamic approximation is used to derive the stability of the closed-loop system. In particular, a suboptimal algorithm of stabilizing MPC for time-varying non-linear systems is provided to decrease the online computation burden. The performance and effectiveness of the proposed approaches is illustrated by some comparisons with MPC algorithms based on linear polytopic descriptions.},

Already in [1], a survey of decentralized control methods for large-scale systems published in the late 1970s, it was stressed that "when considering large systems the presupposition of centrality fails to hold due either to the lack of centralized information or the lack of centralized computing capability." Hence, the concerns regarding the applicability of centralized control strategies are anything but new. Nevertheless, there have been changes that have radically transformed the way in which these concerns are faced by control engineers. In particular, the strong development since the late 1990s of information and communication technologies (ICTs), on the one hand, and computational power, on the other, have boosted the application of noncentralized control techniques to problems beyond the scope of a few decades ago, such as the control of traffic [2] or electricity networks [3], [4].},

Force plates, however, impose constraints on foot placement, and the available pressure sensitive insoles measure only one component of force. In this study, shoes instrumented with two force transducers measuring forces and moments in three dimensions were evaluated. Technical performance was assessed by comparing force measurement and centre of pressure reconstructions of the instrumented shoes against a force plate. The effect of the instrumented shoes on gait was investigated using an optical tracking system and a force plate. Instrumented shoes were compared against normal shoes and weighted shoes. The ground reaction force measured with force plate and instrumented shoes differed by 2.2+/-0.1% in magnitude and by 3.4+/-1.3 degrees in direction. The horizontal components differed by 9.9+/-3.8% in magnitude and 26.9+/-10.0 degrees in direction. Centre of pressure location differed by 13.7+/-2.4mm between measurement systems. A MANOVA repeated measures analysis on data of seven subjects, revealed significant differences in gait pattern between shoe types (p</=0.05). A subsequent univariate analysis showed significant differences only in maximum ground reaction force but these could not be attributed to specific shoe types by pair-wise comparison. This study indicates that shoes instrumented with force transducers can be a valuable alternative to current measurement systems if accurate sensing of position and orientation of the force transducers is improved. They are applicable in ambulatory settings and suitable for inverse dynamics analysis.},

In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the area of fast small-scale solvers for linear MPC, with the two main research areas of explicit MPC and tailored on-line MPC. State-of-the-art solvers in this second class can outperform optimized linear-algebra libraries (BLAS) only for very small problems, and do not explicitly exploit the hardware capabilities, relying on compilers for that. This approach can attain only a small fraction of the peak performance on modern processors. In our paper, we combine high-performance computing techniques with tailored solvers for MPC, and use the specific instruction sets of the target architectures. The resulting software (called HPMPC) can solve linear MPC problems 2 to 8 times faster than the current state-of-the-art solver for this class of problems, and the high-performance is maintained for MPC problems with up to a few hundred states.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: A simple ankle-foot exoskeleton that assists plantarflexion during push-off can reduce the metabolic power during walking. This suggests that walking performance during a maximal incremental exercise could be improved with an exoskeleton if the exoskeleton is still efficient during maximal exercise intensities. Therefore, we quantified the walking performance during a maximal incremental exercise test with a powered and unpowered exoskeleton: uphill walking with progressively higher weights.

METHODS: Nine female subjects performed two incremental exercise tests with an exoskeleton: 1 day with (powered condition) and another day without (unpowered condition) plantarflexion assistance. Subjects walked on an inclined treadmill (15 %) at 5 km h(-1) and 5 % of body weight was added every 3 min until exhaustion.

RESULTS: At volitional termination no significant differences were found between the powered and unpowered condition for blood lactate concentration (respectively, 7.93 ± 2.49; 8.14 ± 2.24 mmol L(-1)), heart rate (respectively, 190.00 ± 6.50; 191.78 ± 6.50 bpm), Borg score (respectively, 18.57 ± 0.79; 18.93 ± 0.73) and [Formula: see text] peak (respectively, 40.55 ± 2.78; 40.55 ± 3.05 ml min(-1) kg(-1)). Thus, subjects were able to reach the same (near) maximal effort in both conditions. However, subjects continued the exercise test longer in the powered condition and carried 7.07 ± 3.34 kg more weight because of the assistance of the exoskeleton.

CONCLUSION: Our results show that plantarflexion assistance during push-off can increase walking performance during a maximal exercise test as subjects were able to carry more weight. This emphasizes the importance of acting on the ankle joint in assistive devices and the potential of simple ankle-foot exoskeletons for reducing metabolic power and increasing weight carrying capability, even during maximal intensities.},

In this paper, a compact rotary series elastic actuator (cRSEA) is designed considering these requirements. To magnify the torque generated by an electric motor in the limited space of the compact device, a worm gear is utilized. However, the actual torque amplification ratio provided by the worm gear is different from the nominal speed reduction ratio due to friction, which makes the controller design challenging. In this paper, the friction effect is considered in the model of cRSEA, and a robust control algorithm is designed to precisely control the torque output in the presence of nonlinearities such as the friction. The mechanical design and dynamic model of the proposed device and the design of a robust control algorithm are discussed, and actuation performance is verified by experiments. Experimental results with a human subject are also presented to show the performance of the cRSEA while interacting with humans.},

Since machine windings experience a substantial back-emf during generation, stator phase currents tend to increase even after the phase is turned off. This in turn necessitates an oversized converter, thereby increasing the cost and overall size of the system. Moreover, due to variations in speed of the prime mover, the power electronic converter should be designed for the worst possible case. This will magnify the additional cost and size issues. Furthermore, implementation of a current profiling scheme for specific reasons such as active vibration cancellation, etc. requires an online estimation of the motional back-emf. In the present paper, a novel method for controlling the current in SRG is proposed. This method enhances the cost and size of the power electronics converter. In addition, using an online estimation of motional back-emf, it makes current profiling in the stator windings possible. This will pave the way for advanced applications of SRG in automotive, aerospace and other challenging places. It must be noted that this method does not require any extra circuitry or memory for its implementation.},

   abstract = {Long-term standing is associated with multiple health problems affecting the lower extremity including musculoskeletal discomfort and fatigue. Unfortunately, many occupations require workers to endure prolonged periods of time spent standing. This research study investigated the effect of anti-fatigue flooring on subjective measures of discomfort and behavioral responses during long-term standing and walking. In addition to other measures of fatigue, near infrared spectroscopy was used to measure tissue oxygenation in the soleus and erector spinae muscles. Changes in muscle SO2 can provide insight to the physiological processes that occur within muscles throughout long-term standing and walking. The goal was to determine the association between muscle SO2 and subjective discomfort measures. Three flooring surfaces were examined in this study: a hard tile, a standard ergonomic soft mat, and a rubber tile. Subjects stood for 6 hours and walked for 2 hours on each of the 3 flooring surfaces. During this time, subjects rated levels of perceived discomfort while objective measures of fatigue were monitored. Flooring surface had a minimal impact on subjective discomfort during long-term standing. Additionally, erector spinae and soleus SO2 were poorly related to subjective discomfort ratings. No significant changes in muscle SO2 were found over time standing however, a positive relationship was revealed between soleus SO2 and postural movements. Flooring effects were found after just 1 hour in subjective measures during long-term walking. Walking on the soft mat reduced overall leg tiredness, upper back discomfort, ankle discomfort, and feet discomfort compared to walking on the hard tile. Muscle SO2 significantly increased from resting values but similar to the standing protocol, no flooring effects were found during long-term walking. The results from this research suggest the development of subjective discomfort during long-term standing is not easily related to changes in muscle SO2 likely due to the increase in postural movements. The effect of flooring on muscle SO2 is inconclusive due to the similarities in subjective discomfort found across flooring conditions examined in this study.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: . Evidence supports peroneal nerve functional electrical stimulation (FES) as an effective alternative to ankle-foot orthoses (AFO) for treatment of foot drop poststroke, but few randomized controlled comparisons exist. OBJECTIVE: . To compare changes in gait and quality of life (QoL) between FES and an AFO in individuals with foot drop poststroke. METHODS: . In a multicenter randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov #NCT01087957) with unblinded outcome assessments, 495 Medicare-eligible individuals at least 6 months poststroke wore FES or an AFO for 6 months. Primary endpoints: 10-Meter Walk Test (10MWT), a composite of the Mobility, Activities of Daily Living/Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, and Social Participation subscores on the Stroke Impact Scale (SIS), and device-related serious adverse event rate. Secondary endpoints: 6-Minute Walk Test, GaitRite Functional Ambulation Profile (FAP), Modified Emory Functional Ambulation Profile (mEFAP), Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Timed Up and Go, individual SIS domains, and Stroke-Specific Quality of Life measures. Multiply imputed intention-to-treat analyses were used with primary endpoints tested for noninferiority and secondary endpoints tested for superiority. RESULTS: . A total of 399 subjects completed the study. FES proved noninferior to the AFO for all primary endpoints. Both the FES and AFO groups improved significantly on the 10MWT. Within the FES group, significant improvements were found for SIS composite score, total mFEAP score, individual Floor and Obstacle course time scores of the mEFAP, FAP, and BBS, but again, no between-group differences were found. CONCLUSIONS: . Use of FES is equivalent to the AFO. Further studies should examine whether FES enables better performance in tasks involving functional mobility, activities of daily living, and balance.},

As it is difficult to predict the outcome of the electrical stimulation rehabilitation process, a diagnostic procedure was developed to predict soon after accidents which incomplete SCI patients are candidates for permanent use of a functional electrical stimulation (FES) orthotic aid. The candidates for chronic use of FES are patients with weak ankle dorsiflexors and sufficiently strong knee extensors. These patients are equipped with a single channel peroneal stimulator augmenting dorsiflexion and knee and hip flexion in a total lower limb flexion response. By applying FES to the ankle plantar flexors, the swing phase of walking can be significantly shortened and faster walking obtained.},

It was found that the new hip joint was associated with a reduced energy cost and increased step length. A simple application of FES assisted hip flexion further increased walking speed and step length and reduced energy cost and crutch force impulse.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Electrical stimulation has been shown effective in restoring basic lower extremity motor function in individuals with paralysis. We tested the hypothesis that a flat interface nerve electrode (FINE) placed around the human tibial or common peroneal nerve above the knee can selectively activate each of the most important muscles these nerves innervate for use in a neuroprosthesis to control ankle motion. APPROACH: During intraoperative trials involving three subjects, an eight-contact FINE was placed around the tibial and/or common peroneal nerve, proximal to the popliteal fossa. The FINE's ability to selectively recruit muscles innervated by these nerves was assessed. Data were used to estimate the potential to restore active plantarflexion or dorsiflexion while balancing inversion and eversion using a biomechanical simulation. MAIN RESULTS: With minimal spillover to non-targets, at least three of the four targets in the tibial nerve, including two of the three muscles constituting the triceps surae, were independently and selectively recruited in all subjects. As acceptable levels of spillover increased, recruitment of the target muscles increased. Selective activation of muscles innervated by the peroneal nerve was more challenging. SIGNIFICANCE: Estimated joint moments suggest that plantarflexion sufficient for propulsion during stance phase of gait and dorsiflexion sufficient to prevent foot drop during swing can be achieved, accompanied by a small but tolerable inversion or eversion moment.},

By substituting an initial cyclic muscle strengthening with an active stimulated standing, four patients with T3-11 lesions started walking with electrical stimulation in 10-17 days. They walked without ankle-foot orthoses. With a satisfactory stride length of 0.75-0.97 m, their gait velocity ranged from very slow to that of a leisurely healthy gait. Already established stimulation of the quadriceps muscles for standing and of the peroneal nerves for lower limb flexion during the swing phase of gait was applied. Diminished limb flexion after several weeks was restored by an increase of the stimulation frequency of the peroneal nerve from 20 to 60 Hz. EMG and kinesiological measurements displayed an improved direct response of the ankle as well as of the reflex mediated hip, knee and ankle flexion response. At the same time stimulation frequency was reduced to 16 Hz for the quadriceps muscles in order to reduce fatigue.},

filtered Smith predictor-based model predictive control algorithm
with embedded variable constraint mapping to take advantage of: (i)
linear control without losing the intrinsic non-linearities typical
of thermal power plants; (ii) including input amplitude constraint
handling capabilities due to control signal saturations induced,
for example, by strong irradiance disturbances or plant start-up;
and (iii) avoiding unstable or highly oscillatory responses caused
by plant-model mismatch. Simulation studies are first presented to
analyze robustness and constraint-mapping features, and real experimental
tests of this technique in the AQUASOL desalination plant solar field
have been included to demonstrate the advantages of its implementation,
especially for reference tracking despite disturbances. (C) 2009

   abstract = {A critical notion in the field of communication-limited control is
the smallest data rate above which there exists a stabilising coding
and control law for a given plant. This quantity measures the lowest
rate at which information can circulate in a stable feedback loop
and provides a practical guideline for the allocation of communication
resources. In this paper, the exponential stabilisability of finite-dimensional
LTI plants with limited feedback data rates is investigated. By placing
a probability density on the initial state and casting the objective
in terms of state moments, the problem is shown to be similar to
one in asymptotic quantisation. Quantisation theory is then applied
to obtain the infimum stabilising data rate over all causal coding
and control laws, under mild requirements on the initial state density.},

by subjects' motor intention was developed in our previous study.
The effectiveness of the FES-robot on wrist training was investigated
in this work. Five hemiplegic subjects with chronic stroke were recruited
for an FES-robot assisted wrist training with 20 sessions. After
the training, motor improvements were found in the wrist and fingers,
represented by significant increase (P lt;;;0.05) in clinical scores
of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA), the Action Research Arm Test
(ARAT), and the Modified Ashworth Score (MAS). Muscle coordination
in the upper limb was also improved during the training as assessed
by electromyography. The increased ARAT scores suggested improved
upper limb motor functions, especially in the hand and fingers, compared
to no improvement in previous study with only interactive robot-assisted
wrist training without FES.},

   abstract = {We consider the problem of cooperation among a collection of vehicles
performing a shared task using intervehicle communication to coordinate
their actions. Tools from algebraic graph theory prove useful in
modeling the communication network and relating its topology to formation
stability. We prove a Nyquist criterion that uses the eigenvalues
of the graph Laplacian matrix to determine the effect of the communication
topology on formation stability. We also propose a method for decentralized
information exchange between vehicles. This approach realizes a dynamical
system that supplies each vehicle with a common reference to be used
for cooperative motion. We prove a separation principle that decomposes
formation stability into two components: Stability of this is achieved
information flow for the given graph and stability of an individual
vehicle for the given controller. The information flow can thus be
rendered highly robust to changes in the graph, enabling tight formation
control despite limitations in intervehicle communication capability.},

@article{Lin1999,
   abstract = {The emergence of nomadic applications have generated much interest
in wireless network infrastructures that support real-time communications.
We propose a bandwidth routing protocol for quality-of-service (QoS)
support in a multihop mobile network. The QoS routing feature is
important for a mobile network to interconnect wired networks with
QoS support (e.g., ATM, Internet, etc.). The QoS routing protocol
can also work in a stand-alone multihop mobile network for real-time
applications. This QoS routing protocol contains end-to-end bandwidth
calculation and bandwidth allocation. Under such a routing protocol,
the source (or the ATM gateway) is informed of the bandwidth and
QoS available to any destination in the mobile network. This knowledge
enables the establishment of QoS connections within the mobile network
and the efficient support of real-time applications. In addition,
it enables more efficient call admission control. In the case of
ATM interconnection, the bandwidth information can be used to carry
out intelligent handoff between ATM gateways and/or to extend the
ATM virtual circuit (VC) service to the mobile network with possible
renegotiation of QoS parameters at the gateway. We examine the system
performance in various QoS traffic flows and mobility environments
via simulation. Simulation results suggest distinct performance advantages
of our protocol that calculates the bandwidth information. It is
particularly useful in call admission control. Furthermore, &tandby&routing
enhances the performance in the mobile environment. Simulation experiments
show this improvement},

   abstract = {This paper proposes a new method for automatic tuning of the Smith
predictor controller based on a Repetitive Control (RC) approach.
The method requires the input of a periodic reference signal which
can be derived from a relay feedback experiment. A modified repetitive
control scheme repetitively changes the control signal to achieve
tracking error convergence. Once a satisfactory performance is achieved
through the learning control, the parameters of the Smith predictor
controller can be computed from the signals using a nonlinear least
squares algorithm. The same relay feedback experiment can provide
an initial parameter vector for an efficient implementation of the
parameter estimation. Simulations and experimental results will be
furnished to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed tuning
method.},

@article{Yan2005,
   abstract = {Background and Purpose-- The effectiveness of functional electrical
stimulation (FES) has been investigated in chronic hemiplegia. The
present study examines whether FES, given during acute stroke, was
more effective in promoting motor recovery of the lower extremity
and walking ability than standard rehabilitation alone. 


Methods-- Forty-six subjects, 70.9\{+/-\}8.0 years old and 9.2\{+/-\}4.1
days after stroke, were assigned randomly to 1 of 3 groups receiving
standard rehabilitation with FES or placebo stimulation or alone
(control). FES was applied 30 minutes and placebo stimulation 60
minutes, 5 days per week for 3 weeks. Outcome measurements included
composite spasticity score, maximum isometric voluntary contraction
of ankle dorsi-flexors and planter-flexors, and walking ability.
They were recorded before treatment, weekly during the 3-week treatment,
and at week 8 after stroke. 


Results-- No significant differences were found in the baseline measurements.
After 3 weeks of treatment, there was a significant reduction in
the percentage of composite spasticity score, and a significant improvement
in the ankle dorsiflexion torque, accompanied by an increase in agonist
electromyogram and a reduction in electromyogram cocontraction ratio
in the FES group, when compared with the other 2 groups (P<0.05).
All subjects in the FES group were able to walk after treatment,
and 84.6% of them returned home, in comparison with the placebo (53.3%)
and control (46.2%, P<0.05) groups. 


Conclusions-- Fifteen sessions of FES, applied to subjects with acute
stroke plus standard rehabilitation, improved their motor and walking
ability to the degree that more subjects were able to return to home.},

@article{Thomas2003,
   abstract = {Muscles paralyzed by chronic (>1 yr) spinal cord injury fatigue readily.
Our aim was to evaluate whether the fatigability of paralyzed thenar
muscles (n = 10) could be reduced by the repeated delivery of variable
versus constant frequency pulse trains. Fatigue was induced in four
ways. Intermittent supramaximal median nerve stimulation (300-ms-duration
trains) was delivered at 1) constant high frequency (13 pulses at
40 Hz each second for 2 min); 2) variable high frequency (each second
for 2 min). The first two intervals of each variable frequency train
were 5 and 20 ms. The remaining pulses were evenly distributed in
time across 275 ms. The number of pulses varied for each subject
such that the force time integral in the unfatigued state matched
that evoked by a constant 40-Hz train; 3) constant low frequency
(7 pulses at 20 Hz each second for 4 min); and 4) variable low frequency
(each second for 4 min). The pulse pattern was the same as that for
variable high frequency except that the force-time integral was matched
to that produced by the constant low-frequency stimulation. These
same experiments were performed on the thenar muscles of five able-bodied
control subjects. The variable high-frequency trains used to fatigue
paralyzed and control muscles had an average (+/- SE) of 12 +/- 2
and 10 +/- 1 pulses, respectively. Variable low-frequency trains
had 7 +/- 1 and 6 +/- 1 pulses, respectively. Significant mean force
declines of comparable magnitude (to 20-25% initial fatigue force
or to 13-21% initial 50 Hz force) were seen in paralyzed muscles
with all four stimulation protocols. The force reductions in paralyzed
muscles were always accompanied by significant increases in half-relaxation
time and decreases in force-time integral, irrespective of the stimulation
protocol. Significant force decreases also occurred in control muscles
during each fatigue test. Again, these force declines were similar
whether constant or variable pulse patterns were used at high or
low frequencies (to 40-60% initial fatigue force or to 29-36% initial
50 Hz force). The force reductions in control muscles were significantly
less than those seen in paralyzed muscles, except when constant high-frequency
stimulation was used. The variations in stimulation frequency, pulse
pattern, and pulse number used in this study therefore had little
influence on thenar muscle fatigue in control subjects or in spinal
cord-injured subjects with chronic paralysis.},

   abstract = {This paper summarizes the results of screening for participation in research programs involving functional neuromuscular stimulation (FNS). It examines the characteristics of a group of children and teenagers with spinal cord injuries (SCI) identified as potential candidates for FNS as defined by the rigorous inclusion criteria of the research studies. One hundred and thirteen children and teenagers under the age of 20 with cervical, thoracic or lumbar level spinal cord injuries were examined for inclusion in an experimental program of FNS to provide standing, walking, or prehension. Although biased towards adolescents with complete midthoracic and midcervical injuries, the age, sex, injury level, etiology, and neurological status of the sample coincided with previously published reports and consisted predominantly of teenage males injured in motor vehicle or sports related accidents. Approximately half of the individuals examined were physically appropriate for research participation without preparatory intervention. Treatment options to prepare individuals for FNS were identified in 25% of those considered inappropriate at the initial evaluation, indicating that the potential user population of clinical systems may be larger than estimates obtained from research applications. Peripheral denervation was the single most prevalent physical impediment to the application of FNS. Although the incidence of lower motor neuron (LMN) involvement was similar in subjects with tetraplegia and paraplegia, those with cervical lesions more frequently exhibited other medical complications that interfered with the application of FNS. Surgical procedures involving transfer of paralyzed but excitable muscles were identified in almost one third of the candidates with tetraplegia who were excluded due to denervation. Of those physically appropriate, psychological factors eliminated several candidates from consideration. Such concerns may also be addressed with suitable intervention in preparation for the clinical application of FNS. Almost 50% of those appropriate for FNS research elected to participate in the programs, with those declining citing the hospitalization, time and travel commitments as the primary factors influencing their decisions. Results suggest that FNS for standing, walking and hand grasp may be an option for a significant percentage of the pediatric SCI population.},

   abstract = {A novel guaranteed robustness/performance adaptive algorithm with
limited torque is proposed for tracking control of robot manipulators
in this paper. In framework of the adaptive controller, a continuous
differentiable increasing function is introduced into the parameter
estimator of controller so as to restrain from parameter drifting.
Furthermore, both robustness and performance are guaranteed without
any persistent excitation (PE) condition: (i) asymptotic stability
is achieved in absence of disturbance when the estimation of parameter-range
is available; (ii) the close-loop system is Lp input/output stable
and its solution is uniformly ultimately bounded regardless whether
the true parameters are located within the estimated parameter-range
or not. Finally, taking some practical complexity into account, such
as disturbances, dead-zone as well as dynamics of brushed direct-current
motor, simulation results via three-dof robot manipulator show the
significant improvement in terms of robustness and performance in
comparison with the conventional adaptive and projection algorithm.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether functional electrical stimulation
(FES) timed to activate the dorsiflexors and plantar flexors during
gait improves the walking of adults with hemiplegia. DESIGN: Randomized
crossover trial. SETTING: Outpatient rehabilitation clinic. PARTICIPANTS:
Adults with hemiplegia (N=28) with a mean age +/- SD of 60+/-10.9
years and 4.9+/-3.8 years postincident. INTERVENTIONS: Intervention
"A" included 3 months of wearing the FES system, which activated
automatically during walking for 6 to 8h/d, 7d/wk, plus walking 1h/d,
6d/wk. Intervention "B" included 3 months of walking 1h/d, 6d/wk
without FES. Of the 28 patients who completed the study, 15 were
randomly assigned to group A-B, 13 to group B-A. Crossover occurred
at 3 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Variables were measured at pretreatment,
3 months, and 6 months. Three primary outcomes were selected a priori
and included 2 functional variables, the 6-minute walk test and the
Emory Functional Ambulatory Profile, and 1 participation variable,
the Stroke Impact Scale. Secondary impairment measures included muscle
strength and spasticity. Assessments were done without electrical
stimulation. RESULTS: In phase 1, patients who received treatment
A (A-B group) showed improvement compared with patients who received
treatment B (B-A group) on the 6-minute walk test (P=.02), Emory
Functional Ambulatory Profile (P=.08), and Stroke Impact Scale (P=.03).
In phase 2, the A-B group maintained improvement in all 3 primary
outcomes even without FES. Both groups improved significantly on
all primary outcome measures, comparing 6-month to initial measures
(P</=.05). CONCLUSIONS: An FES system that stimulates dorsiflexors
and plantar flexors similar to the timing of typical adult gait,
combined with daily walking, can improve the walking ability of adults
with hemiplegia.},

   abstract = {This short communication is a preliminary report on a study concerning
slowing down the rate of muscle fatigue when FES (Functional Electrical
Stimulation) is applied for standing and walking by complete (traumatic)
thoracic-level paraplegics. It is shown that randomly modulating
the inter-pulse interval between FES pulses (which serve to trigger
action potentials in the peripheral nerves concerned) results in
a significantly lower rate of muscle fatigue, as tested in a series
of leg extensions, when FES was applied at the quadriceps. Specifically,
we report that the best results (longest durations of leg extension
prior to onset of muscle-fatigue) were achieved with a +/- 5 msec
uniformly-distributed (pseudo-) white-noise modulation at a 42 msec
inter-pulse interval (24 pulses per sec). These resulted in an average
increase in duration of leg extension of approximately 37% in this
pilot study, as compared with unmodulated (fixed-rate) trains of
FES pulses. This significant increase, even in a very preliminary
study appears to merit careful further examination, since it may
allow a possibly significant increase in standing duration and in
walking range of paraplegics using FES for ambulation.},

   abstract = {Previous studies have suggested that during sustained maximal voluntary
and evoked contractions, decreasing activation rates may minimize
fatigue. The idea of gradually decreasing stimulation frequency to
preserve force during fatiguing isometric contractions has, however,
recently been challenged. The primary purpose of this study was to
test the effectiveness of decreasing or increasing electrical stimulation
rates during evoked, repetitive, submaximal, non-isometric contractions
of healthy human quadriceps femoris muscles. The ability of the muscles
to produce a 50 degrees knee excursion repetitively was evaluated
using low-frequency trains, high-frequency trains, and a combination
of these trains. Results showed that stimulating the muscles with
high-frequency trains followed by low-frequency trains produced the
worst performance and starting with low-frequency trains followed
by high-frequency trains produced the best performance. Present results
cast doubt on the applicability of decreasing stimulation rates during
non-isometric contractions and suggest that a combination of trains
that begin at a low frequency and then switch to a higher-frequency
may improve performance during functional electrical stimulation.},

@article{Grosset2008,
   abstract = {When measured in vivo electromechanical delay (EMD) depends mainly
on the elastic properties of the muscle-tendon unit. Recent studies
have shown changes in stiffness of the triceps surae (TS) following
a period of training. To confirm the influence of musculo-tendinous
stiffness on EMD, this study investigates paired changes in these
two parameters after a training period. Two types of training known
to induce opposite changes in stiffness were analysed. EMD and musculo-tendinous
stiffness were measured on adult subjects before and after 10 weeks
of endurance (n = 21) or plyometric (n = 9) trainings. EMD was defined
as the time lag between the TS M-wave latency and the onset of muscle
twitch evoked at rest by supramaximal electrical stimulations of
the posterior tibial nerve. Quick release tests were used to evaluate
the musculo-tendinous stiffness of the ankle plantar flexors. The
stiffness index was defined as the slope of the relationship between
angular stiffness and external torque values. Endurance training,
known to preferentially activate the slow, stiffer muscle fibers,
leads to a decrease in EMD and to an increase in stiffness index.
Following plyometric training, which specifically recruits fast,
more compliant fibers, EMD and the stiffness index exhibited adaptations
directionally opposite to those seen with endurance training. When
pooling the data for the two subject groups, a correlation was found
between changes in EMD and changes in musculo-tendinous stiffness
indexes. Thus, changes in EMD values are proposed to indirectly link
to changes in musculo-tendinous stiffness for subjects involved in
muscle training.},

   abstract = {Functional electrical stimulation can assist paralyzed individuals
to perform functional movements, but muscle fatigue is a major limitation
to its practical use. An accurate and predictive mathematical model
can facilitate the design of stimulation patterns that optimize aspects
of the force transient while minimizing fatigue. Solution nonuniqueness,
a major shortcoming in previous work, was overcome with a simpler
model. The model was tested on data collected during isometric contractions
of rat gastrocnemius muscles and human quadriceps femoris muscles
under various physiological conditions. For each condition tested,
parameter values were identified using the force response to one
or two stimulation trains. The parameterized model was then used
to predict forces in response to other stimulation patterns. The
predicted forces closely matched the measured forces. The model was
not sensitive to initial parameter estimates, demonstrating solution
uniqueness. By predicting the force that develops in response to
an arbitrary pattern of stimulation, we envision the present model
helping identify optimal stimulation patterns for activation of skeletal
muscle during functional electrical stimulation.},

@article{Tanaka1991,
   abstract = {To compare nerve regeneration in young adult and aging mice, the right
sciatic nerves of 6- and 24-month-old mice were crushed at the sciatic
notch. Two weeks later, both groups of mice were perfused with an
aldehyde solution, and, after additional fixation, the sciatic nerves
were processed so that the transverse sections of each nerve subsequently
studied by light and electron microscopy included the entire posterior
tibial fascicle 5 mm distal to the crush site. The same level was
sectioned in unoperated contralateral nerves; these nerves served
as controls. Electron micrographs and the Bioquant Image Analysis
System IV were used to measure areas of posterior tibial fascicles
and count the number of myelinated axons, the number of unmyelinated
axons, and their frequency in Schwann cell units. In aging mice,
the total number of regenerating myelinated axons was significantly
reduced, but totals of regenerating unmyelinated axons in aging and
young adults did not differ significantly. In aging mice, the frequency
of Schwann cells that contained a single unmyelinated axon was greater,
suggesting that before myelination began, Schwann cell ensheathment
of axons also was slowed. After axotomy by a crush injury, the area
of the posterior tibial fascicle was less than that in young adults
and the distal disintegration of myelin sheath remnants also appeared
to be retarded. The results indicate that responses of neurons, axons,
and Schwann cells could be important in slowing the regeneration
of myelinated fibers found in sciatic nerves from aging mice.},

   abstract = {Security is a critical issue in a mobile ad hoc network (MANET). We
propose and investigate a novel scheme, security protocol for reliable
data delivery (SPREAD), to enhance the data confidentiality service
in a mobile ad hoc network. The proposed SPREAD scheme aims to provide
further protection to secret messages from being compromised (or
eavesdropped) when they are delivered across the insecure network.
The basic idea is to transform a secret message into multiple shares
by secret sharing schemes and then deliver the shares via multiple
independent paths to the destination so that even if a small number
of nodes that are used to relay the message shares are compromised,
the secret message as a whole is not compromised. We present the
overall system architecture and investigate the major design issues.
We first describe how to obtain message shares using the secret sharing
schemes. Then we study the appropriate choice of the secret sharing
schemes and the optimal allocation of the message shares onto each
path in order to maximize the security. The results show that the
SPREAD is more secure and also provides a certain degree of reliability
without sacrificing the security. Thirdly, the multipath routing
techniques are discussed and the path set optimization algorithm
is developed to find the multiple paths with the desired property,
i.e., the overall path set providing maximum security. Finally, we
present the simulation results to justify the feasibility and evaluate
the effectiveness of SPREAD.},

   abstract = {Objective To investigate the effects of functional electrical stimulation
(FES) combined with conventional rehabilitation program on the effort
and speed of walking, the surface electromyographic (sEMG) activity
and metabolic responses in the management of drop foot in stroke
subjects.


Methods Fifteen patients with a drop foot resulting from stroke at
least 3�months prior to the start of the trial took part in this
study. All subjects were treated 1�h a day, 5�days a week, for 12�weeks,
including conventional stroke rehabilitation program and received
30�min of FES to the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle of the paretic
leg in clinical settings. Baseline and post-treatment measurements
were made for temporal and spectral EMG parameters of TA muscle,
walking speed, the effort of walking as measured by physiological
cost index (PCI) and metabolic responses.


Results The experimental results showed a significant improvement
in mean-absolute-value (21.7%), root-mean-square (66.3%) and median
frequency (10.6%) of TA muscle EMG signal, which reflects increased
muscle strength. Mean increase in walking speed was 38.7%, and a
reduction in PCI of 34.6% between the beginning and at end of the
trial. Improvements were also found in cardiorespiratory responses
with reduction in oxygen consumption (24.3%), carbon dioxide production
(19.9%), heart rate (7.8%) and energy cost (22.5%) while walking
with FES device.


Conclusions The results indicate that the FES may be a useful therapeutic
tool combined with conventional rehabilitation program to improve
the muscle strength, walking ability and metabolic responses in the
management of drop foot with stroke patients.},

   abstract = {Objective. Spinal reciprocal inhibitory and excitatory reflexes of
ankle extensor and flexor muscles were investigated in ambulatory
participants with chronic central nervous system (CNS) lesions causing
foot drop as a function of time after lesion and stimulator use.


Methods. Thirty-nine participants with progressive (eg, secondary
progressive MS) and 36 with generally nonprogressive (eg, stroke)
conditions were studied. The tibialis anterior (TA) and soleus maximum
H-reflex/M-wave (Hmax/Mmax) ratios and maximum voluntary contractions
(MVC) were measured and compared with those in age-matched control
participants. Reciprocal inhibition was measured as a depression
of the ongoing electromyographic (EMG) activity produced by antagonist
muscle�nerve stimulation. 


Results. Participants with CNS lesions had significantly higher soleus
Hmax/Mmax ratios than control participants, and reduced voluntary
modulation of the reflexes occurred in both muscles. Reciprocal inhibition
of soleus from common peroneal (CP) nerve stimulation was not significantly
different from controls in either group. Inhibition of the TA by
tibial nerve stimulation decreased and was eventually replaced by
excitation in participants with nonprogressive disorders. No significant
change occurred in progressive disorders. Use of a foot drop stimulator
increased the TA, but not the soleus MVC overall. H-reflexes only
showed small changes. Reciprocal inhibition of the TA increased considerably,
while that of the soleus muscle decreased toward control values.



Conclusions. Disorders that produce foot drop also produce reflex
changes, some of which only develop over a period of years or even
decades. Regular use of a foot drop stimulator strengthens voluntary
pathways and changes some reflexes toward control values. Thus, stimulators
may provide multiple benefits to people with foot drop.},

   abstract = {The problem of controlling delayed systems has been widely studied
in the control community. The Smith predictor (SP) scheme was the
most famous and efficient technique to cope with this problem. Afterwards,
robustness problems and those related to the control of integrating
and unstable delayed processes were resolved. This work presents
an interactive tool for studying and understanding the different
alternatives available for controlling systems with large delays.
Interactive tools have provided excellent support for the control
community during recent years. In this sense, the tool developed
here helps to compare easily the performance of PID controllers and
SP approaches for processes with delay, as well as other control
structures used to solve different problems that the original SP
has when integrator and unstable models are employed. Robustness
problems due to presence of model uncertainties can also be analyzed.
Furthermore, some real industrial processes are also described as
motivation in the study of the problems presented in the paper. The
tool incorporates a set of typical transfer functions based on these
real industrial processes.},

of a significant class of nonlinearly parameterized systems with
uncontrollable unstable linearization. While there may not exist
any smooth static or dynamic stabilizer due to the violation of the
well-known necessary condition, we give sufficient conditions for
the existence of non-Lipschitz continuous adaptive regulators that
achieve global stability with asymptotic state regulation. A constructive
design method is developed based on an effective coupling of a new
parameter separation technique and the tool of adding a power integrator,
leading to Cadaptive regulators with minimal parameterization. Indeed,
the dimension of the proposed dynamic compensator can always be one,
irrespective of the number of unknown parameters. The power of our
continuous adaptive control strategy is demonstrated by solving a
number of challenging adaptive stabilization problems that have remained
open for more than a decade},

the effect of stimulation frequency on muscle force responses. The
aim of this study was to enhance our isometric mathematical model
to predict muscle forces in response to stimulation trains with a
wide range of frequencies and intensities for the quadriceps femoris
muscles of individuals with spinal cord injuries. Isometric forces
were obtained experimentally from 10 individuals with spinal cord
injuries (time after injury, 1.5-8 years) and then compared to forces
predicted by the model. Our model predicted accurately the force-time
integrals (FTI) and peak forces (PF) for stimulation trains of a
wide range of frequencies (12.5-80 HZ) and intensities (150-600-mus
pulse duration), and two different stimulation patterns (constant-frequency
trains and doublet-frequency trains). The accurate predictions of
our model indicate that our model, which now incorporates the effects
of stimulation frequency, intensity, and pattern on muscle forces,
can be used to design optimal customized stimulation strategies for
spinal cord-injured patients.},

@article{Kebaetse2005,
   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of combining different stimulation
frequencies on the ability of paralyzed human quadriceps muscle to
produce a 50 degrees knee excursion repetitively when starting at
90 degrees of flexion. DESIGN: Repeated-measures design. SETTING:
Clinical research laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Complete data were collected
from 9 subjects aged 11 to 25 years (mean +/- standard deviation,
17.1+/-4.5y) with spinal cord injury (SCI). INTERVENTION: Three protocols
were each tested during separate sessions: 20-Hz trains of pulses
followed by 66-Hz trains (C20+66), 33-Hz trains followed by 66-Hz
trains (C33+66), and 66-Hz trains alone (C66). For each frequency,
stimulation was repeated until the knee failed to produce a 50 degrees
excursion. This approach allowed us to evaluate the response to stimulation
with 20-, 33-, and 66-Hz and combinations of 20- and 66-Hz and 33-
and 66-Hz trains. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Number of successful contractions.
RESULTS: The C20 and C33 did not differ (mean, 41.0+/-12.6 excursions
and 42.0+/-12.3 excursions, respectively), and each produced more
excursions than the C66 protocol. The C20+66 and C33+66 protocols
produced 51.4+/-15.0 and 44.9+/-13.6 excursions, respectively, and
the C20+66 was the best protocol overall (all P<or=.05). CONCLUSIONS:
This study showed that stimulation strategies that start with low
frequencies and switch to higher frequencies as the muscle fatigues
could improve the ability of functional electric stimulation applications
to perform repetitive, nonisometric contractions in subjects with
SCI.},

@article{Masani2006,
   abstract = {To compensate for significant time delays in the control of human
bipedal stance, it was suggested that a feed-forward control mechanism
is needed to generate a preceding motor command to the body sway
position observed in quiet standing. In this article, we present
evidence that a feedback proportional-derivative (PD) controller
can effectively generate a desired preceding motor command. We also
discuss the following characteristics of the proposed PD controller:
(1) the level of robustness of the controller with respect to neurological
time delays and (2) how well the controller replicates the system's
dynamics observed in experiments with able bodied subjects, i.e.
how well the controller generates the observed preceding motor command.
Human quiet stance was simulated using an inverted pendulum model
regulated by a PD controller. The simulations were used to calculate
the center of mass (COM) position and velocity data, and the motor
command (ankle joint torque) data as a function of time. These data
and the data obtained in the experiments were compared using cross-correlation
functions (CCFs). The results presented herein imply that a PD feedback
controller is capable of ensuring balance during human bipedal quiet
stance, even if the neurological time delays are considerable. The
proposed feedback controller can generate the preceding motor command
that was observed in the experiments. Therefore, we conclude that
a feed-forward mechanism is not necessary to compensate for the long
closed-loop time delay in human bipedal stance as suggested in recent
literature, and that the PD controller is a good approximation of
the control strategy applied by able bodied subjects during quiet
stance.},

   abstract = {Global analysis of the power system markets shows that load frequency
control (LFC) is one of the most profitable ancillary services of
these systems. This service is related to the short-term balance
of energy and frequency of the power systems and acquires a principal
role to enable power exchanges and to provide better conditions for
electricity trading. The main goal of the LFC problem is to maintain
zero steady-state errors for frequency deviation and good tracking
of load demands in a multi-area power system. This paper provides
an overview of control strategies for researchers, as well as of
their current use in the field of LFC problems. The history of control
strategies is outlined. Various control methodologies based on the
classical and optimal control, robust, adaptive, self-tuning control,
VSC systems, digital and artificial intelligent/soft computing control
techniques are discussed. We make various comparisons between these
approaches, and the main advantages and disadvantages of the methods
are presented. Finally, the investigations of the LFC problem incorporating
BES/SMES, wind turbines and FACTs devices have also been discussed.},

   abstract = {Electromechanical delays (EMD), the time from onset of EMG activity
to change in acceleration or deceleration of the forearm, were studied
in concentric and eccentric contractions of biceps and triceps brachii
muscles. Horizontal flexion and extension movements were performed
at varying speeds by 10 subjects. EMD time in concentric contractions
for biceps was 41 +/- 13 ms and for triceps was 26 +/- 11 ms and
was not influenced by the velocity of the movement. In eccentric
contractions at the slow velocity the biceps EMD time was 38 +/-
13 ms and shortened to 28 +/- 10 ms at the faster velocity. The eccentric
triceps EMD, however, was not significantly altered by movement velocity
and averaged 30 +/- 7 ms. The data provided support for the hypothesis
that stretching of the series elastic component, to a point where
muscle force can be detected, is the primary determinant of the EMD
phenomenon. However, there are complex interactions of the effects
on EMD of muscle fiber type composition, whether the contraction
is concentric or eccentric, and the velocity of the movement as well
as possible gamma system influence. These complications require that
consideration of electromechanical delay be made when phasic relationships
between muscle force or joint torque generation from different muscles
are inferred from EMGs.},

   abstract = {A major limitation of many functional electrical stimulation (FES)
applications is that muscles tend to fatigue very rapidly. It was
hypothesized that FES-induced muscle fatigue could be reduced by
randomly modulating the pulse frequency, amplitude, and pulse width
in a range of +/-15%. Seven subjects with spinal-cord injuries participated
in this study. FES was applied to quadriceps and tibialis anterior
muscles using surface electrodes. Isometric force was measured, and
the time for the force to drop by 3 dB (fatigue time) was compared
between trials. Four different modes of FES were applied in random
order: constant stimulation, randomized frequency, randomized amplitude,
and randomized pulse width. There was no significant difference between
the fatigue-time measurements for the four modes of stimulation (P=0.329).
Therefore, random modulation appeared to have no effect. Based on
an observed correlation between maximum force measurements and trial
order, we concluded that having 10-min rest periods between trials
was insufficient.},

linear system by means of state feedback when the measurements of
the state are quantized is addressed. It is found that there is no
control strategy that stabilizes the system in the traditional sense
of making all closed-loop trajectories asymptotic to zero. If the
system is not excessively unstable, feedback strategies that bring
closed-loop trajectories arbitrarily close to zero for a long time
can be implemented. It is also found that when the ordinary linear
feedback of quantized state measurements is applied, the resulting
closed-loop system behaves chaotically. The asymptotic pseudorandom
closed-loop system dynamics differ substantially from what would
be predicted by a conventional signal-with-noise analysis of the
quantization's effects. Probabilistic reformulations of the stability
problem in terms of the invariant measure are considered},

   abstract = {Purpose. To evaluate the clinical efficacy of functional electrical
stimulation (FES) therapy of the tibialis anterior (TA)

muscle on gait restoration and enhancing motor recovery with stroke
patients.


Method. Thirty hemiparetic participants with spastic foot-drop impairments
who were at least 3 months post-stroke were

recruited from a rehabilitation institute and were assigned either
to a control group or a FES group. Both the groups

participated in a conventional stroke rehabilitation program for 60
min per day, 5 days a week, for 12-weeks. The FES group

received the electrical stimulation to the TA muscle for correction
of foot-drop.


Results. Functional electric stimulation (FES) resulted in a 26.3%
(p50.001) improvement of walking speed measured

with 10-m walkway, whereas the improvement in the control group was
only 11.5% (p50.01). The FES group also showed

significantly greater improvements compared to control group in other
gait parameters (e.g. cadence, step length),

physiological cost index (PCI), ankle range of motion, spasticity
of calf muscle, Fugl�Meyer scores, and the maximum value

of the root mean square (RMSmax), which reflects the capacity of the
muscle output.


Conclusions. These findings suggest that, the FES therapy combined
with conventional therapy treatment more effectively

improves the walking},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the influence of a 6-week neuromuscular training
program on the electromechanical delay and reaction time of the peroneus
longus muscle. DESIGN: A 2 x 2 pre-post factorial design. SETTING:
Human performance research center biomechanics laboratory. PARTICIPANTS:
Thirty-six healthy, physically active, college-age subjects were
recruited for this study and 26 completed it. There were 5 men and
8 women in the treatment group (mean age +/- standard deviation,
21.9+/-2.1 y; height, 173.7+/-11.1cm; weight, 67.4+/-17.8 kg) and
6 men and 7 women in the control group (age, 21.8+/-2.3 y; height,
173.7+/-11.9 cm; weight, 70.8+/-19.4 kg). Subjects were not currently
experiencing any lower-extremity pathology and had no history of
injuries requiring treatment to either lower extremity. INTERVENTIONS:
Subjects in the treatment group completed a 6-week neuromuscular
training program involving various therapeutic exercises. Subjects
in the control group were asked to continue their normal physical
activity during the 6-week period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The electromechanical
delay of the peroneus longus was determined by the onset of force
contribution after artificial activation, as measured by electromyographic
and forceplate data. Reaction time was measured after a perturbation
during walking. Data were analyzed using two 2 x 2 analyses of covariance
(covariate pretest score). Group (treatment, control) and sex (male,
female) were between-subject factors. RESULTS: Neuromuscular training
caused a decrease in reaction time to perturbation during walking
compared with controls (F=4.030, P=.029), while there was a trend
toward an increase in electromechanical delay (F=4.227, P=.052).
There was no significant difference between sexes or the interaction
of sex and treatment in either reaction time or electromechanical
delay. CONCLUSIONS: The 6-week training program significantly reduced
reaction time of the peroneus longus muscle in healthy subjects.
Neuromuscular training may have a beneficial effect on improving
dynamic restraint during activity.},

   abstract = {The twitch of the triceps surae muscle (TS), which characterizes the
contractile properties independently of volition, differs in amplitude,
but not in time course, when evoked in pre or postpubertal children.
The aim of the present study was to compare the TS twitch contractile
properties in prepubertal children (7 to 11 y). M-wave and twitch
were recorded at rest by supramaximal electrical stimulations of
the posterior tibial nerve. Twitches were characterized by peak torque
(Pt), contraction time (CT), half relaxation time (HRT), and rate
of torque development (dPt/dt). Electromechanical delay (EMD) was
quantified with regard to the TS M-wave onset. Pt values increased
significantly with the age of the prepubertal children but remained
lower than that for adult subjects. CT and HRT values did not change
with age. Thus, dPt/dt increased significantly between the 7-year-old
and the 11-year-old children but remained significantly lower than
that for adults. Despite EMD values decreased with age, they remained
significantly higher than those of adult subjects. These results
confirmed the link between growth processes and the increase in twitch
torque for prepubertal children within a limited range of age. However,
the time-course characteristics were not affected by age. The increase
in dPt/dt and the decrease in the EMD could be used as indirect indicators
of changes in contractile kinetics and in musculo-tendinous stiffness
with the age of the prepubertal children. The age-related relationships
established by this study will serve as reference values for clinical
testing of the TS performances in relation to muscle disease or disuse.},

a calorimeter used for performance evaluation of refrigerant compressors.
A phenomenological model of the process is developed and a simple
linear model is obtained considering the dynamics near an operating
point. Experimental results are also used to identify a simple linear
model from real data. As the process exhibits an integrative behavior
plus a dead time, a dead-time compensator specially designed for
integrating plants is used to control the output temperature of the
calorimeter. Robustness and implementation issues are discussed and
experimental results in closed loop are presented to demonstrate
the good performance of the controller.},

   abstract = {There are two general structures to design a control systemthrough
a network. The first structure is to have several subsystems, inwhich
each of the subsystem contains a set of sensors, a set ofactuators,
and a controller by itself. These system components areattached to
the same control plant. In this case, a subsystem controllerreceives
a set point from the central controller. Another structure isto connect
a set of sensors and a set of actuators to a networkdirectly. Sensors
and actuators in this case are attached to a plant,while a controller
is separated from the plant via a network connectionto perform a
closed-loop control over the network. A challenging problemin control
of networked-based system is network delay effects. The timeto read
a sensor measurement and to send a control signal to an actuatorthrough
the network depends on network characteristics such as theirtopologies,
routing schemes, etc. Therefore, the overall performance ofa network-based
control system can be significantly affected by networkdelays. The
severity of the delay problem is aggravated when data lossoccurs
during a transmission. Moreover, the delays do not only degradethe
performance of a network-based control system, but also candestabilize
the system. This tutorial presents fundamental details ofnetwork-based
control and recent network-based control techniques forhandling the
network delays. The techniques are based on variousconcepts such
as state augmentation, queuing and probability theory,nonlinear control
and perturbation theory, and scheduling. A generalstructure of a
network-based control system, delay types, and delaybehaviors are
also described in this tutorial. In addition, advantages and disadvantages
of these techniques are discussed},

to government agencies, universities, and research organizations
to ensure continued progress in areas of importance to the industrial
and defense base. The panel released a report in April 2002, the
intent of which is to raise the overall visibility of research in
control, highlight its importance in applications of national interest,
and indicate some of the key trends that are important for continued
vitality of the field. After a brief introduction, we summarize the
report, discuss its applications and education and outreach, and
conclude with some recommendations.},

@article{Minshull2007,
   abstract = {Neuromuscular performance capabilities, including those measured by
evoked responses, may be adversely affected by fatigue; however,
the capability of the neuromuscular system to initiate muscle force
rapidly under these circumstances is yet to be established. Sex-differences
in the acute responses of neuromuscular performance to exercise stress
may be linked to evidence that females are much more vulnerable to
anterior cruciate ligament injury than males. Optimal functioning
of the knee flexors is paramount to the dynamic stabilisation of
the knee joint, therefore the aim of this investigation was to examine
the effects of acute maximal intensity fatiguing exercise on the
voluntary and magnetically-evoked electromechanical delay in the
knee flexors of males and females. Knee flexor volitional and magnetically-evoked
neuromuscular performance was assessed in seven male and nine females
prior to and immediately after: (1) an intervention condition comprising
a fatigue trial of 30-s maximal static exercise of the knee flexors,
(2) a control condition consisting of no exercise. The results showed
that the fatigue intervention was associated with a substantive reduction
in volitional peak force that was greater in males compared to females
(15.0, 10.2%, respectively, P < 0.01) and impairment to volitional
electromechanical delay in females exclusively (19.3%, P < 0.05).
Similar improvements in magnetically-evoked electromechanical delay
in males and females following fatigue (21%, P < 0.001), however,
may suggest a vital facilitatory mechanism to overcome the effects
of impaired voluntary capabilities, and a faster neuromuscular response
that can be deployed during critical times to protect the joint system.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Electrical stimulation of damaged peripheral nerve may
aid regeneration. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine
whether 1 mA of percutaneous electrical stimulation at 1, 2, 20,
or 200 Hz augments regeneration between the proximal and distal nerve
stumps. METHODS: A10-mm gap was made in rat sciatic nerve by suturing
the stumps into silicone rubber tubes. A control group received no
stimulation. Starting 1 week after transection, electrical stimulation
was applied between the cathode placed at the distal stump and the
anode at the proximal stump every other day for 6 weeks. RESULTS:
Higher frequency stimulation led to less regeneration compared to
lower frequencies. Quantitative histology of the successfully regenerated
nerves revealed that the groups receiving electrical treatment, especially
at 2 Hz, had a more mature structure with a smaller cross-sectional
area, more myelinated fibers, higher axon density, and higher ratio
of blood vessel to total nerve area compared with the controls. Electrophysiology
showed significantly shorter latency, longer duration, and faster
conduction velocity. CONCLUSION: Electrical stimulation can have
either a positive or negative impact on peripheral nerve regeneration.
Clinical trials that combine stimulation with rehabilitation must
determine the parameters that are most likely to be safe and effective.},

   abstract = {Because muscles must be repetitively activated during functional electrical
stimulation, it is desirable to identify the stimulation pattern
that produces the most force. Previous experimental work has shown
that the optimal pattern contains an initial high-frequency burst
of pulses (i.e., an initial doublet or triplet) followed by a low,
constant-frequency portion. Pattern optimization is particularly
challenging, because a muscle's contractile characteristics and,
therefore, the optimal pattern change under different physiological
conditions and are different for each person. This work describes
the continued development and testing of a mathematical model that
predicts isometric forces from fresh and fatigued muscles in response
to brief trains of electrical pulses. By use of this model and an
optimization algorithm, stimulation patterns that produced maximum
forces from each subject were identified.},

reliability of electromechanical delay (EMD) and torque of the dominant
and non-dominant elbow flexors during isometric and isokinetic muscle
contractions repeated over five consecutive days. Eleven volunteers
that were unfamiliar with isokinetic dynamometry participated in
this study and were asked to attend the laboratory on five consecutive
days. An isokinetic dynamometer was used to exercise the elbow flexors
under isometric, slow (60 degrees s(-1)) and fast (210 degrees s(-1))
isokinetic conditions; surface electromyography was recorded from
the belly of biceps brachii and the signal was synchronised with
the dynamometer to determine EMD. Intra-subject reliability for all
measures was good (CV range, 3.1-6.5%) with no discernable difference
between the dominant and non-dominant arms during isometric and isokinetic
conditions. In addition, there was little difference in EMD and torque
variability between the dominant and non-dominant arms which may
have applications for clinicians and future research design when
monitoring and investigating human muscle function. These data provide
researchers and clinicians with an indication of the magnitude of
change that is required to elucidate the presence of a meaningful
change to muscle function in the elbow flexors.},

   abstract = {Fifteen male subjects performed a series of unrestricted, unidirectional
45 degrees elbow extensions at three different initial muscle lengths
and at four movement velocities. Online electromyography, accelerometry,
and electrogoniometry were used in the data collection to investigate
the relationship between the myoelectric activity during the electromechanical
delay and various kinematic variables representing the concentric
phase of the muscular contraction. Results indicate that the integral
of the myoelectric signal during the electromechanical delay is a
more reliable variable than the duration of the latency which was
shown to be inconsistent in its ability to discriminate between manipulated
conditions. It appears that the use of electromyographical quantification
of the electromechanical delay can be useful in the derivation of
preacceleration muscular force and perhaps provide an noninvasive
technique to quantify the elastic characteristics of muscle and the
contributions of the elastic response to movement.},

   abstract = {Control of integrating processes with long deadtime is a challenging
problem. Using original Smith predictor control structure will result
in an offset problem during load disturbance. Using the internal
model control (IMC) principle to design the control structure will
result in large overshoot during servo response. In this work, a
simple modified Smith predictor controller design is proposed for
this important type of system. The overall control structure has
only two physically meaningful tuning parameters. One is used to

   abstract = {This study investigated the effect of prolonged intermittent high
intensity exercise upon the isokinetic leg strength and electromechanical
delay of the knee flexors. Seven male collegiate soccer players were
exposed to: (i) a prolonged intermittent high intensity exercise
task (PIHIET) which required subjects to complete a single-leg pedalling
task, with the preferred limb, (75 rpm for all constant-load portions
of the task) consisting of 48 x 1.8 minute cycles of exercise, and
(ii) a control task consisting of no exercise. Pre-, mid- and post-PIHIET
gravity corrected indices of knee flexion angle-specific torque (0.44
rad knee flexion (AST); 0 rad=full knee extension; [1.05 rad x s(-1)])
were made for both intervention and control limbs. Electromechanical
delay (EMD) of the m. biceps femoris during supine knee flexion movements
was evaluated in the preferred leg on both intervention and control
days. Repeated measures ANOVAs revealed significant condition (intervention;
control) by time (pre; mid; post) interactions for both knee flexor
AST (F[2,12]=4.8; p < 0.03) and EMD (F[2,12]=4.1; p < 0.05). AST
was observed to decrease by 16% and EMD increase by 30% pre to
post intervention. These observations suggest an impairment of neuromuscular
control and the ability to maintain force generation in the knee
flexors, near the extremes of the range of motion during prolonged
intermittent high-intensity exercise activities. Changes of this
magnitude may pose a threat to the integrity of the knee joint.},

with input delay by using active mass damper (AMD) is considered.
The linearized Morison equation is employed to estimate wave-induced
forces, the dominant loads that offshore structures are subjected
to, which can be taken as harmonic excitation for the system. Firstly,
an Artstein model reduction method is applied to reduce the system
free of delay. Secondly, a Feedback and Feedforward (FFOC) algorithm
is brought forward to damp the forced oscillation in an optimal fashion.
Finally, a numerical example of the FFOC law for a jacket-type offshore
platform by using of AMD is studied. The simulation results show
the algorithm proposed is efficient.},

   abstract = {A Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) is a collection of wireless mobile
hosts that form a temporary network without a centralized administration
or wired infrastructure. Because of its dynamic topology, a MANET's
routing protocol is different from other networks. Network control
with Quality of Service (QoS) support is a key issue for multimedia
applications in MANET. This paper proposes QoS Routing with Mobility
Prediction (QRMP) protocol. This protocol selects the most stable
path based on mobility prediction and QoS requirements on bandwidth
and delay. The impact of our improvements is evaluated through simulations.
The protocol is expected to efficiently support real-time multimedia
traffic with different QoS requirements},

is stable for stable/unstable or minimum/non-minimum phase systems.
Based on the predicted undelayed output, any available control design
procedure can be applied to fulfil the control requirements, the
delay remaining unchanged. Disturbance rejection and robustness may
be enhanced based on the estimation error. The approach is shown
to work in all considered cases and comparison with other methods,
when available in the literature, is reported.},

   abstract = {This paper is concerned with the stabilization problem of networked
control systems where the main focus is the packet-loss issue. Two
types of packet-loss processes are considered. One is the arbitrary
packet-loss process, the other is the Markovian packet-loss process.
The stability conditions of networked control systems with both arbitrary
and Markovian packet losses are established via a packet-loss dependent
Lyapunov approach. The corresponding stabilizing controller design
techniques are also given based upon the stability conditions. These
results are also extended to the unit time delay case. Finally, the
numerical example and simulations have demonstrated the usefulness
of the developed theory.},

@article{Shield2004,
   abstract = {The twitch interpolation technique is commonly employed to assess
the completeness of skeletal muscle activation during voluntary contractions.
Early applications of twitch interpolation suggested that healthy
human subjects could fully activate most of the skeletal muscles
to which the technique had been applied. More recently, however,
highly sensitive twitch interpolation has revealed that even healthy
adults routinely fail to fully activate a number of skeletal muscles
despite apparently maximal effort. Unfortunately, some disagreement
exists as to how the results of twitch interpolation should be employed
to quantify voluntary activation. The negative linear relationship
between evoked twitch force and voluntary force that has been observed
by some researchers implies that voluntary activation can be quantified
by scaling a single interpolated twitch to a control twitch evoked
in relaxed muscle. Observations of non-linear evoked-voluntary force
relationships have lead to the suggestion that the single interpolated
twitch ratio can not accurately estimate voluntary activation. Instead,
it has been proposed that muscle activation is better determined
by extrapolating the relationship between evoked and voluntary force
to provide an estimate of true maximum force. However, criticism
of the single interpolated twitch ratio typically fails to take into
account the reasons for the non-linearity of the evoked-voluntary
force relationship. When these reasons are examined, it appears that
most are even more challenging to the validity of extrapolation than
they are to the linear equation. Furthermore, several factors that
contribute to the observed non-linearity can be minimised or even
eliminated with appropriate experimental technique. The detection
of small activation deficits requires high resolution measurement
of force and careful consideration of numerous experimental details
such as the site of stimulation, stimulation intensity and the number
of interpolated stimuli. Sensitive twitch interpolation techniques
have revealed small to moderate deficits in voluntary activation
during brief maximal efforts and progressively increasing activation
deficits (central fatigue) during exhausting exercise. A small number
of recent studies suggest that resistance training may result in
improved voluntary activation of the quadriceps femoris and ankle
plantarflexor muscles but not the biceps brachii. A significantly
larger body of evidence indicates that voluntary activation declines
as a consequence of bed-rest, joint injury and joint degeneration.
Twitch interpolation has also been employed to study the mechanisms
by which caffeine and pseudoephedrine enhance exercise performance.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine electromechanical
delay (EMD) using supramaximal stimuli and to investigate its variation
with gender, age, contraction level and fatigue. METHODS: Fifteen
male and 15 female healthy subjects (aged between 18 and 60) participated
in our study. Electromyogram (EMG) recordings were taken from triceps
surae muscle. While subjects contracted their muscles voluntarily
at specified percentages of maximum voluntary contraction, 10 supramaximal
stimuli were applied to the tibial nerve. The time lag between the
onset of the EMG response (M-wave) and the onset of force generation
was calculated as EMD. RESULTS: EMD was found to be 8.5+/-1.3 ms
(at rest condition), which is much shorter than those reported in
previous studies. Although EMD did not significantly vary with gender
(P>0.05), it decreased significantly with escalating muscle contraction
level (P<0.05) and increased significantly with advancing age and
with fatigue (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: EMD was found to be considerably
shorter than those reported in previous studies, and hence we discuss
the possible reasons underlying this difference. We suggest that
supramaximal nerve stimulation and high resolution EMG and force
recording may have generated this difference. SIGNIFICANCE: Current
findings suggest that EMD is very sensitive to the method used to
determine it. We discuss the reasons for the short EMD value that
we have found in the present study.},

   abstract = {Electromechanical delay (EMD) represents the time lag between muscle
activation and muscle force production and is used to assess muscle
function in healthy and pathological subjects. There is no experimental
methodology to quantify the actual contribution of each series elastic
component structures that together contribute to the EMD. We designed
the present study to determine, using very high frame rate ultrasound
(4 kHz), the onset of muscle fascicles and tendon motion induced
by electrical stimulation. Nine subjects underwent two bouts composed
of five electrically evoked contractions with the echographic probe
maintained over 1) the gastrocnemius medialis muscle belly (muscle
trials) and 2) the myotendinous junction of the gastrocnemius medialis
muscle (tendon trials). EMD was 11.63 +/- 1.51 and 11.67 +/- 1.27
ms for muscle trials and tendon trials, respectively. Significant
difference (P < 0.001) was found between the onset of muscle fascicles
motion (6.05 +/- 0.64 ms) and the onset of myotendinous junction
motion (8.42 +/- 1.63 ms). The noninvasive methodology used in the
present study enabled us to determine the relative contribution of
the passive part of the series elastic component (47.5 +/- 6.0%
of EMD) and each of the two main structures of this component (aponeurosis
and tendon, representing 20.3 +/- 10.7% and 27.6 +/- 11.4% of EMD,
respectively). The relative contributions of the synaptic transmission,
the excitation-contraction coupling, and the active part of the series
elastic component could not be directly quantified with our results.
However, they suggest a minor role of the active part of the series
elastic component that needs to be confirmed by further experiments.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Locomotor training using body weight support and a treadmill as a therapeutic modality for rehabilitation of walking post-stroke is being rapidly adopted into clinical practice. There is an urgent need for a well-designed trial to determine the effectiveness of this intervention. The objective of the Locomotor Experience Applied Post-Stroke (LEAPS) trial is to determine if there is a difference in the proportion of participants who recover walking ability at one year post-stroke when randomized to a specialized locomotor training program (LTP), conducted at 2- or 6-months post-stroke, or those randomized to a home based non-specific, low intensity exercise intervention (HEP) provided 2 months post-stroke. We will determine if the timing of LTP delivery affects gait speed at 1 year and whether initial impairment severity interacts with the timing of LTP. The effect of number of treatment sessions will be determined by changes in gait speed taken pre-treatment and post-12, -24, and -36 sessions. METHODS/DESIGN: We will recruit 400 adults with moderate or severe walking limitations within 30 days of stroke onset. At two months post stroke, participants are stratified by locomotor impairment severity as determined by overground walking speed and randomly assigned to one of three groups: (a) LTP-Early; (b) LTP-Late or (c) Home Exercise Program -Early. The LTP program includes body weight support on a treadmill and overground training. The LTP and HEP interventions are delivered for 36 sessions over 12 weeks. Primary outcome measure include successful walking recovery defined as the achievement of a 0.4 m/s gait speed or greater by persons with initial severe gait impairment or the achievement of a 0.8 m/s gait speed or greater by persons with initial moderate gait impairment.LEAPS is powered to detect a 20% difference in the proportion of participants achieving successful locomotor recovery between the LTP groups and the HEP group, and a 0.1 m/s mean difference in gait speed change between the two LTP groups. DISCUSSION: The goal of this single-blinded, phase III randomized clinical trial is to provide evidence to guide post-stroke walking recovery programs. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT00243919.},

processes when a reduced model of the process is considered. The
output is estimated from a discrete time representation of the continuous
time model and the tuning of the controllers can be made by any classical
control design approach for systems without delay. The internal stability
and the robust stability of the proposed scheme is proved and a deep
analysis of the disturbance rejection performance is included. As
a result, a tuning procedure is derived. An illustrative example
shows that the robustness and performance of the proposed scheme
are similar or better to those of the more recently proposed dead-time
compensators for stable and integrating processes, its capability
to reject ramp disturbances being also addressed. The proposed scheme
has been tested in a real-time application to control the roll angle
in a laboratory prototype of a quad-rotor helicopter.},

   abstract = {Different opportunistic routing protocols have been proposed recently
for routing in sensor networks. These protocols exploit the redundancy
among nodes by using a node that is available for routing at the
time of packet transmission. This mitigates the effect of varying
channel conditions and duty cycling of nodes that make static selection
of routes not viable. However, there is a downside as each hop may
provide extremely small progress towards the destination or the signaling
overhead for selecting the forwarding node may be too large. In this
paper, we provide a systematic performance evaluation, taking into
account different node densities, channel qualities and traffic rates
to identify the cases when opportunistic routing makes sense. The
metrics we use are power consumption at the nodes, average delay
suffered by packets and goodput of the protocol. Our baseline for
comparison is geographic routing with nodes being duty cycled to
conserve energy. The paper also identifies optimal operation points
for opportunistic routing that minimizes the power consumption at
nodes.},

   abstract = {A simple modified Smith predictor design for the control of non-minimum-phase
integrating processes with/without a zero is proposed. The method
consists of two controllers, one for set point tracking and the other
for disturbance rejection. The controllers are designed based on
direct synthesis approach. The set point tracking controller is designed
as a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) with lag filter and the
disturbance rejection controller is designed as a proportional-derivative
(PD) with lead lag structure. Typical types of integrating processes
with/without zero are considered and the controllers are designed
in a unified approach for all the types of integrating processes.
Extensive simulation studies have been carried out on various integrating
processes with/without zero. The present method gives good disturbance
rejection response and significant improvement when compared to the
recently reported methods in the literature.},

@article{Folland2007,
   abstract = {A number of methodological issues in the use of the interpolated twitch
technique were investigated for their effect on true maximum force
(TMF) and activation (ACT): timing of control (pre- vs post-contraction)
and superimposed twitches (first vs second); type of twitch stimulus
(primarily magnitude); and the type of extrapolation utilised. On
three occasions subjects performed a series of maximal and sub-maximal
contractions of the knee extensors, with electrically evoked twitches
delivered before, during and after each contraction. The twitch-voluntary
force relationship was concave for all types of twitch stimuli, and
extrapolation using this relationship typically calculated TMF 39N
(7%) higher, and ACT 7% lower than linear extrapolation. The timing
of the control (2-4%) and superimposed twitches (approximately 4%)
both influenced TMF and ACT. Despite the different twitch stimuli
being a range of magnitudes (13-32% maximum voluntary force) they
did not affect TMF and ACT. A novel finding was that prior potentiation
changed the shape of the twitch-voluntary force relationship. For
precise measurement of TMF and ACT it is recommended that: extrapolation
is based on the twitch-voluntary force relationship of the experimental
model; and post-contraction potentiated twitches be used, as the
superimposed twitch on a high level contraction appears to be potentiated.},

during ankle unsupported, braced, and taped conditions. Thirty-one
(10 male, 21female) healthy, college-aged subjects participated in
the study (age: 20.9 +/- 1.8 years, mass 70.3 +/- 15.8 kg, height
171.1 +/- 9.6 cm). Each subject was assigned a random order for the
three external support conditions. The subject was positioned on
a force platform and instructed to actively evert the ankle. We examined
the time lag between the onset of electrical activity in the peroneus
longus muscle and a change in force as detected by the force platform.
Five trials were completed for each condition and a repeated measures
ANOVA was used to determine statistical significance. The results
showed no significant difference between the three external support
conditions. We concluded that external support through taping and
bracing does not affect the EMD of the peroneus longus muscle in
healthy subjects.},

task is limited if the shape of the workpiece is unknown. This is
even more true when the workpiece contour contains corners. This
paper shows how a combined vision/force control approach at corners
in planar contour following results in a more accurate and faster
executed task. The vision system is used to measure on-line the contour
and to watch out for corners. The edge is correctly located by incorporating
the compliance of the tool/camera set-up in the contour measurement.
A simple corner detection algorithm is presented. Once a corner is
detected, the finite state controller is activated to take the corner
in the best conditions. Experimental results are presented to validate
the approach},

a device (control) network and IP network. If a fieldbus based distributed
control system (DCS) is implemented on a global VDN, efficiency and
flexibility can be significantly improved. In this study DCS implemented
on the LonWorks/IP VDN is investigated with an example of model reference
adaptive control (MRAC) of a geared DC motor. In order to compensate
for the network induced uncertain time delay inherently present on
VDN, the modified Smith predictor based internal model controller
was integrated to MRAC (MRAC-IMC). The effectiveness of the proposed
control scheme was tested through experiment. The proposed control
scheme exhibited the robustness to noise and external disturbances
and the good tracking performance around zero velocity point occurring
due to overshoot and stick friction. Result of this study suggests
that sophisticated servo control of dynamic systems is possible from
a remote client PC on VDN by properly compensating the network delay.},

proposed structure consists of two control loops, a secondary inner
loop and a primary outer loop. The method has totally three controllers
of which the secondary loop has one controller and the primary loop
has two controllers. The secondary loop controller is designed using
IMC technique. The primary loop set-point tracking and disturbance
rejection controllers are designed using direct synthesis method.
The primary set-point tracking controller is designed as a PID with
lag filter and the primary disturbance rejection controller is designed
as a PD with lead-lag filter. Simulation studies have been carried
out on various cascade integrating processes with/without zero. The
present method gives significant disturbance rejection both in the
inner and outer loops and also shows significant improvement when
compared to the recently reported methods.},

@article{Jaeger1992,
   abstract = {Functional electrical stimulation (FES) applications in the lower
extremity are common in research laboratories, but clinical applications
are minimal. This review summarizes current knowledge with respect
to clinical application. When electrical stimulation is used in clinical
applications for functional movement such as standing and walking,
it is typically applied in an open-loop manner; a predetermined stimulus
pattern is delivered regardless of the consequences of the actual
movement. Few clinical applications of FES involve closed-loop control
because of the numerous difficulties involved in its application.
As with any volitional muscle contraction, electrically stimulated
muscle contractions will exhibit fatigue. Although the dynamics of
fatigue may differ, electrically stimulated muscle contractions cannot
be continuously sustained, and if the duty cycle is too severe, even
alternating periods of rest and contraction cannot be sustained at
a constant force level. The exact nature of fatigue is highly specific
to the past history of the individual muscle and to the individual
subject. Despite their intricate detail, quantitative modeling studies
have not yet been applied extensively to clinical applications. Present
implantable systems are not yet a viable option for clinical application.
It is not clear whether more success with surface or percutaneous
systems must first be achieved to justify implantation or whether
greater improvements in implantable technology and surgical protocols
are needed before implantable systems will become practical. It is
clear that almost any reasonably designed stimulation protocol will
increase muscle bulk. The existence of other therapeutic benefits
and their cost/benefit ratios remain to be fully established. It
is possible to stand through bilateral stimulation of the quadriceps.
Using surface electrodes, this technique is achievable in any physical
therapy clinic having minimal expertise in neuromuscular stimulation.
FES-aided standing must be conducted as a research project with a
protocol approved by the local institutional review board, as there
are currently no FDA-approved stimulation devices for standing. Multichannel
FES systems are not currently available for clinical application
in the United States. This may change if the "Parastep" system receives
FDA approval. Percutaneous and implanted systems are years away from
commercialization and clinical availability. Hybrid systems, based
primarily on the reciprocating gait orthosis (RGO), are presently
the only clinically available form of walking that includes some
form of FES assistance. The costs and benefits of adding FES to the
RGO and the long-term user acceptance rate for these systems remain
to be determined.},

Communication is an important component of these distributed and

interactions between the control components and the communication
components of the distributed system. In this paper, we formulate
a control problem with a communication channel connecting the sensor

and channel decoder along with the controller to achieve different
control objectives. We provide upper and lower bounds on the channel
rate required to achieve these different control objectives. In many
cases, these bounds are tight. In doing so, we characterize the "information
complexity" of different control objectives.},

   abstract = {This paper presents a unified approach for the design of dead-time
compensators. The approach is based on a modified structure of the
Smith predictor that allows to decouple the disturbance and set-point
responses in order to tune the controller for a compromise between
performance and robustness and is able to cope with unstable processes.
The proposed structure is simple to analyse and tune. Moreover a
novel robustness analysis of the unstable case is presented to demonstrate
the limitations imposed by the unstable dynamics and the dead time.
Cases studies are used to illustrate the advantages of the proposed
controller.},

   abstract = {In this work, sliding mode predictive control (SMPC) was applied to
an air conditioning solar plant. The process has a variable time
delay with non-minimum phase behavior, whose inverse response changes
with the operating point. Disturbances are produced by changes in
solar irradiation and solar collectors' inlet temperature. The algorithm
combines the design technique of sliding mode control (SMC) with
model-based predictive control (MPC). The SMPC showed a considerable
robustness improvement with respect to MPC under experimental validation
on a real plant and also showed an enhanced ability to handle set
point changes and disturbance rejection.},

   abstract = {The stimulation of peripheral nerve regeneration has been studied in different ways, including the use of electrical fields. The capacity of this modality to enhance nerve regeneration is influenced by the parameters used, including current type, frequency, intensity, and means of administration. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a frequently used form of administering electrical current to the body, but its effects on peripheral nerve regeneration are not known. This study assessed the influence of TENS on sciatic nerve regeneration, using a model of crush lesion in the mouse. Mice were stimulated 30 min a day, 5 days a week, for 5 weeks with both high- (100 Hz) and low- (4 Hz) frequency TENS. Control animals had the sciatic nerve crushed but were not stimulated. Assessment was performed weekly by functional analysis using the Static Sciatic Index for the mouse and at the end of the experiment by light and electron microscopy. The results showed that although there were no differences between the groups regarding the Static Sciatic Index values, TENS led to nerves with morphological signs of impaired regeneration. At light microscopy level, TENS nerves presented more axons with dark axoplasm, signs of edema, and a less organized cytoarchitecture. Electronmicrographs showed fewer and thinner thick myelinated fibers and increased number of Schwann cell nuclei. Myelinated axon diameters and density and diameter of nonmyelinated fibers were not affected by TENS, leading to the conclusion that this regimen of electrical stimulation leads to a delayed regeneration after a crush lesion of the sciatic nerve in the mouse. All these effects were more pronounced on high-frequency TENS nerves.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether community-dwelling chronic stroke patients wearing an ankle-foot orthosis would benefit from changing to functional electrical stimulation of the peroneal nerve. METHODS: In 26 community-dwelling chronic (> 6 months post-onset) patients after stroke, their ankle-foot orthosis was replaced by a surface-based functional electrical stimulation device (NESS L300). Comfortable walking speed over 10 m was measured at baseline with the ankle-foot orthosis and after 2 and 8 weeks with both ankle-foot orthosis and functional electrical stimulation. The level of physical activity was assessed with a pedometer, and patients' satisfaction was assessed with a questionnaire at baseline and at week 8 regarding ankle-foot orthosis and functional electrical stimulation, respectively. RESULTS: Ankle-foot orthosis and functional electrical stimulation were equally effective with regard to walking speed and activity level. The participants were more satisfied with functional electrical stimulation than with their ankle-foot orthosis regarding the effort and stability of walking, quality of the gait pattern, walking distance, comfort of wearing and appearance of the device. CONCLUSION: The patients judged functional electrical stimulation superior to their ankle-foot orthosis, but measurements of walking speed and physical activity could not objectify the experienced benefits of functional electrical stimulation. Other outcome measures focusing on the stability and effort of ambulation may objectify the perceived benefits of functional electrical stimulation in community-dwelling chronic stroke patients.},

   abstract = {There is limited information from literature on the dynamic operability
of membrane processes with multiple stages or loops. Such information
is useful for assessing the performance achievable by an automatic
controller proposed for a process design before the actual controller
is implemented. Based on dynamic modeling of an industrial whey ultrafiltration
process with an increasing number of stages up to a maximum of 12,
the dynamic responses of the flowrate and concentration of the retentate
were obtained. Features of the dynamic responses were used to determine
the performance, in terms of quality and speed, that can be achieved
by automatic controllers. In particular, limitations on the performance
are indicated by features of dynamic responses such as effective
time delay and inverse responses. Changes in effective time delay
and inverse responses with the number of stages in the whey ultrafiltration
process demonstrate a trade-off between process performance and control
performance. This trade-off should be considered during process and
controller design to maximize the economic return from the production
of whey protein concentrates.},

   abstract = { Communication is an important component of distributed and networked
controls systems. In our companion paper, we presented a framework
for studying control problems with a digital noiseless communication
channel connecting the sensor to the controller. Here, we generalize
that framework by applying traditional information theoretic tools
of source coding and channel coding to the problem. We present a
general necessary condition for observability and stabilizability
for a large class of communication channels. Then, we study sufficiency
conditions for Internet-like channels that suffer erasures.},

channel connecting the sensor to the controller. The problem consists
of designing the channel encoder and decoder as well as the controller
to satisfy some given control objectives. In particular, we examine
the role communication has on the classical linear quadratic Gaussian
problem. We give conditions under which the classical separation
property between estimation and control holds and the certainty equivalent
control law is optimal. We then present the sequential rate distortion
framework. We present bounds on the achievable performance and show
the inherent tradeoffs between control and communication costs. In
particular, we show that optimal quadratic cost decomposes into two
terms: A full knowledge cost and a sequential rate distortion cost.},

Despite the fact that novel drugs for axonal regeneration in the

walking have not reached widespread clinical acceptance yet, devices
are available for demonstrable improvement of the grasp function.
This applies to tetraplegic patients with stable, active shoulder
function, but missing control of hand and fingers. Particularly,
with the use of implantable systems a long-term stable, user-friendly
application is possible. Most recent work aims at the development
of minimally invasive, subminiature systems for individual functional
support. The possibility of direct brain control of FES systems will
extend the application of grasp neuroprostheses to patients with
injuries of the highest cervical spinal cord.},

   abstract = {Electromechanical delay (EMD) is a measurement used to assess the
mechanical lag between muscle activation onset and force production.
EMD measurements may be performed by voluntary or electrically evoked
muscle activation. This study compared gastrocnemius EMD during voluntary
and involuntary contractions and assessd the intrasession reliability
of each set of measurements. Subjects were 15 volunteers (age 21
+/- 2 years, ht 171.8 +/- 10.0 cm, mass 76.1 +/- 13.4 kg). EMD measurements
were recorded from the medial head of the gastrocnemius of each subject
during voluntary and involuntary contractions. Order was counterbalanced
between subjects. Subjects stood with the dominant leg on a force
plate, the nondominant next to the force plate, and with their hands
in contact with a bar in front of them. A supramaximal percutaneous
stimulus was applied to the tibial nerve in the popliteal fossa for
involuntary (electrically evoked) contractions. For voluntary contractions,
subjects were instructed to rise up on the toes as quickly as possible.
Four trials were collected for each condition with 30 s of rest between
each. Repeated measures ANOVAs were performed for each condition
to calculate an ICC (2,1). Means of the 4 trials for each condition
were used to detect differences between groups. EMD was greater in
the voluntary condition (22.8 +/- 8.2 ms) compared to the involuntary
condition (9.7 +/- 3.1 ms; p < .001). Intrasession reliability for
each condition was very strong (involuntary ICC (2,1) = .977; voluntary
ICC (2,1) = .972). EMD measured during a single leg stance is much
shorter when measured during an electrically evoked (voluntary) contraction.
The difference in EMD between conditions is likely the result of
differences in recruitment during the two types of contractions.
Reliability within a measurement session was very strong for each
of the conditions.},

design. The tool is based on an unified dead-time compensator and
considers models commonly used in industrial process control. The
main contribution of this work is that the proposed tool and controller
are simple to analyze and tune as they are based on an unique modified
structure of the Smith predictor valid for every type of dead-time
process (including integrating and unstable systems). Simple frequency
analysis and block diagram transformations are used together with
simulations to illustrate the main problems associated to the control
of dead-time processes. Several examples of typical processes are
presented to illustrate the fundamental concepts associated to the
control of these systems. The interactive tool is not only useful
for designing and analyzing but also for training and educational
purposes.},

@article{NairTAC04,
   abstract = { It is well known in the field of dynamical systems that entropy can
be defined rigorously for completely deterministic open-loop systems.
However, such definitions have found limited application in engineering,
unlike Shannon's statistical entropy. In this paper, it is shown
that the problem of communication-limited stabilization is related
to the concept of topological entropy, introduced by Adler et al.
as a measure of the information rate of a continuous map on a compact
topological space. Using similar open cover techniques, the notion
of topological feedback entropy (TFE) is defined in this paper and
proposed as a measure of the inherent rate at which a map on a noncompact
topological space with inputs generates stability information. It
is then proven that a topological dynamical plant can be stabilized
into a compact set if and only if the data rate in the feedback loop
exceeds the TFE of the plant on the set. By taking appropriate limits
in a metric space, the concept of local TFE (LTFE) is defined at
fixed points of the plant, and it is shown that the plant is locally
uniformly asymptotically stabilizable to a fixed point if and only
if the data rate exceeds the plant LTFE at the fixed point. For continuously
differentiable plants in Euclidean space, real Jordan forms and volume
partitioning arguments are then used to derive an expression for
LTFE in terms of the unstable eigenvalues of the fixed point Jacobian.},

   abstract = {An analytical design for a proportional-integral derivative (PID)
controller cascaded with a first order lead/lag filter is proposed
for integrating and first order unstable processes with time delay.
The design algorithm is based on the internal model control (IMC)
criterion, which has a single tuning parameter to adjust the performance
and robustness of the controller. A setpoint filter is used to diminish
the overshoot in the servo response. In the simulation study, the
controllers were tuned to have the same degree of robustness by measuring
the maximum sensitivity, Ms, in order to obtain a reasonable comparison.
Furthermore, the robustness of the controller was investigated by
inserting a perturbation uncertainty in all parameters simultaneously
to obtain the worst case model mismatch, and the proposed method
showed more robustness against process parameter uncertainty than
the other methods. For the selection of the closed-loop time constant,
[lambda], a guideline is also provided over a broad range of time-delay/time-constant
ratios. The simulation results obtained for the suggested method
were compared with those obtained for other recently published design
methods to illustrate the superiority of the proposed method.},

   abstract = {The emerging area of control with limited data rates incorporates
ideas from both control and information theory. The data rate constraint
introduces quantization into the feedback loop and gives the interconnected
system a two-fold nature, continuous and symbolic. In this paper,
we review the results available in the literature on data-rate-limited
control. For linear systems, we show how fundamental tradeoffs between
the data rate and control goals, such as stability, mean entry times,
and asymptotic state norms, emerge naturally. While many classical
tools from both control and information theory can still be used
in this context, it turns out that the deepest results necessitate
a novel, integrated view of both disciplines},

@article{Kesar2009,
   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is
a popular poststroke gait rehabilitation intervention. Although stroke
causes multijoint gait deficits, FES is commonly used only for the
correction of swing-phase foot drop. Ankle plantarflexor muscles
play an important role during gait. The aim of the current study
was to test the immediate effects of delivering FES to both ankle
plantarflexors and dorsiflexors on poststroke gait. METHODS: Gait
analysis was performed as subjects (N=13) with chronic poststroke
hemiparesis walked at their self-selected walking speeds during walking
with and without FES. RESULTS: Compared with delivering FES to only
the ankle dorsiflexor muscles during the swing phase, delivering
FES to both the paretic ankle plantarflexors during terminal stance
and dorsiflexors during the swing phase provided the advantage of
greater swing-phase knee flexion, greater ankle plantarflexion angle
at toe-off, and greater forward propulsion. Although FES of both
the dorsiflexor and plantarflexor muscles improved swing-phase ankle
dorsiflexion compared with noFES, the improvement was less than that
observed by stimulating the dorsiflexors alone, suggesting the need
to further optimize stimulation parameters and timing for the dorsiflexor
muscles during gait. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to the typical FES
approach of stimulating ankle dorsiflexor muscles only during the
swing phase, delivering FES to both the plantarflexor and dorsiflexor
muscles can help to correct poststroke gait deficits at multiple
joints (ankle and knee) during both the swing and stance phases of
gait. Our study shows the feasibility and advantages of stimulating
the ankle plantarflexors during FES for poststroke gait.},

   abstract = {Urinary levels of antibiotics determine the outcome of treatment of most urinary tract infections. The antibacterial effect of gentamicin against Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in urine was studied. With use of urinary constituents in concentrations normally found in human urine, it was shown that urine has an inhibitory effect that is dependent upon the acidity and total osmolality of the urine, as well as upon the presence of individual solutes. Up to 40 times as much gentamicin may be needed to prevent the growth of E. coli or P. aeruginosa in concentrated, acidic human urine as is required in broth. This inhibitory effect may be particularly important when urinary concentrations of gentamicin are reduced either because of a reduction in dosage or because of decreased excretion due to renal insufficiency.},

   abstract = {After a spinal cord injury (SCI) of the cat or rat, neuronal centers below the level of lesion exhibit plasticity that can be exploited by specific training paradigms. In individuals with complete or incomplete SCI, human spinal locomotor centers can be activated and modulated by locomotor training (facilitating stepping movements of the legs using body weight support on a treadmill to provide appropriate sensory cues). Individuals with incomplete SCI benefit from locomotor training such that they improve their ability to walk over ground. Load- or hip joint-related afferent input seems to be of crucial importance for both the generation of a locomotor pattern and the effectiveness of the training. However, it may be a critical combination of afferent signals that is needed to generate a locomotor pattern after severe SCI. Mobility of individuals after a SCI can be improved by taking advantage of the plasticity of the central nervous system and can be maintained with persistent locomotor activity. In the future, if regeneration approaches can successfully be applied in human SCI, even individuals with complete SCI may recover walking ability with locomotor training.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Functional Neuromuscular Stimulation (FNS) for unbraced short-distance ambulation by traumatic complete/near-complete T4 to T12 paraplegics is based on work by Graupe et al (1982), Kralj et al (1980), Liberson et al (1961), and others. This paper discusses methodology, performance, training, admissibility criteria, and medical observations for FNS-ambulation using the Parastep-I system, which is the first and only such system to have received FDA approval (1994) and which emanated from these previous works. METHOD: The Parastep system is a transcutaneous non-invasive and microcomputerized electrical stimulation system built into a Walkman-size unit powered by eight AA batteries that is controlled by finger-touch buttons located on a walker's handbars for manual selection of stimulation menus. The microcomputer shapes, controls, and distributes trains of stimulation signals that trigger action potentials in selected peripheral nerves. Walker support is used for balance. The patient can don the system in under 10 minutes. At least 32 training sessions are required. RESULTS: Approximately 400 patients have used the Parastep system, essentially all achieving standing and at least 30 feet of ambulation, with a few reaching as much as 1 mile at a time. Recent literature presents data on the medical benefits of using the Parastep system-beyond the exercise benefits of short distance ambulation at will-such as increased blood flow to the lower extremities, lower HR at subpeak work intensities, increased peak work capability, reduced spasticity, and psychological benefits. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that the Parastep FNS system, which is presently commercially available by prescription, is easily usable for independent short-distance ambulation. We believe that its exercise benefits and its other medical and psychological benefits, as discussed, make it an important option for thoracic-level traumatic paraplegics.},

   abstract = {Paraplegia means a live long sentence of sensory loss, paralysis and dependence with approximately 1000 new victims in every European country every year and 11.500 new traumatic SCI cases in the US. respectively. Sixty percent are injured before age 30. More than 90% of SCI victims may survive with nearly normal experience of live. Most patients will recover somewhat from SCI over time but no patient who remained plegic for one year regains voluntary motor function after that time period. Despite remarkable efforts and recent achievements in rehabilitation no treatment can be recommended so far to enhance functional recovery and restoring locomotion in paraplegic humans. FES as a technical compensation has become therefore a challenging treatment to restore muscle function and to prevent atrophy and to improve mobility and quality of life at the same time. In paraplegics FES could be the basis to restore locomotion. One of the advantages of an implanted FES version (neuroprosthesis) is that the FES system, electrodes, and cables remain permanently implanted within the body, so that the patient can stay without cables, the programmer attached to the crutches. The SUAW project, supported under BIOMED II Programme by the European Community was aimed to finalize and to put into practice the results of previous research and development. The novel implant with an ASCI-Chip has 16 channels, 8 on each side, 20 mA for monopolar and 2 mA for bipolar stimulation, only one electrode can be stimulated at a given time. Stimulation of 6 muscle groups of both legs are known to be sufficient for locomotion: M. ileopsoas (erector of the body, hip flexor), M. gluteus maximus (hip extensor), M. gluteus medius (lateral hip stabilisator, knee abductor), Mm. hamstrings (knee flexor) stimulated by epimysial electrodes, Mm. sartorius and rectus femoris (knee extensor) stimulated by neural, bipolar electrodes. Patient's selection criteria were: stable spinal cord lesion between T7 and T11, minimum 1 year after the accident without deformity of the spine, the muscle groups for locomotion responding to external FES with the EXOSTIM programmer with the same programme used later for the neuroprosthesis. Two paraplegic male patients, T8, 38 and 31 years old respectively, were operated on by an international group of surgeons according to the protocol in 09/1999, respectively 7/2000. The postop. course was uneventful. Because the threshold of the primary implant was too low regarding scare tissue around the electrodes, this implant was changed in 01/2000 and worked perfectly. Both patients are happy with the success of the novel treatment modalities.},

Ltd, Lane Cove, NSW, Australia) to provide standing and stepping ability and bladder and bowel management for individuals with motor complete thoracic level spinal cord injuries (SCI). SETTING: Pediatric orthopedic hospital specializing in SCI. SUBJECTS: Three males, ages 17 and 21 years, with motor-complete thoracic level SCI and intact lower motor neurons to the muscles targeted for stimulation. METHODS: Each subject was successfully implanted with the Praxis FES system. All three subjects received electrodes for upright mobility and the first two subjects received additional electrodes for stimulated bladder and bowel management. Following training, subjects were evaluated in their ability to use FES for nine mobility activities. Acute and chronic experiments of the effect of stimulation on bowel and bladder function were also performed. RESULTS: All three subjects could independently stand up from the wheelchair and could walk at least 6 m using a swing through gait pattern. Two subjects were able to independently perform swing through gait for 6 min and one subject was able to independently ascend and descend stairs. Suppression of reflex bladder contractions by neuromodulation (subject 1) and stimulated contractions of the rectum (subject 2) were observed in acute experiments. When stimulation was applied over the course of several weeks, a positive effect on bowel function was measured. Stimulated bladder contractions were not achieved. CONCLUSION: The feasibility of using the Praxis FES system for upright mobility and aiding aspects of bladder and bowel function was demonstrated with three subjects with thoracic level SCI.},

OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of a multiweek intervention on walking function in people with chronic, incomplete spinal cord injuries. SETTING: Rehabilitation hospital for spinal cord injury (SCI) in Toronto, Canada. METHODS: A convenience sample of five subjects with chronic, incomplete SCI trained for 12-18 weeks using a new multichannel neuroprosthesis for walking. The following outcome measures were recorded throughout the training period: walking speed, step frequency and average stride length based on a 2-min walk test. Also identified were which walking aids and orthoses subjects preferred to use, and whether they employed a step-to or step-through gait strategy. Follow-up measurements of three subjects were made up to 10 weeks after treatment. RESULTS: All subjects demonstrated significant improvements in walking function over the training period. Four of the subjects achieved significantly increased walking speeds, which were due to increases in both stride length and step frequency. The fifth subject experienced a significant reduction in preferred assistive devices. Follow-up measurements revealed that two subjects walked slightly slower several weeks after treatment, but they still walked significantly faster than at the start of treatment. CONCLUSION: The gait training regimen was effective for improving voluntary walking function in a population for whom significant functional changes are not expected. This application of functional electrical therapy is viable for rehabilitation of gait in incomplete SCI.},

Compex Motion can generate any arbitrary stimulation sequence, which can be controlled or regulated in real-time using any external sensor or laboratory equipment. Compex Motion originated from the existing Compex 2 electric stimulator, manufactured by a Swiss based company, Compex SA. The Compex Motion stimulator represents a further evolution and expansion of the ETHZ-ParaCare functional electrical stimulation system. This stimulator provides all the advanced functional electrical stimulation (FES) application and control features and can be easily incorporated into any standard rehabilitation program. Compex Motion has successfully been applied as a neuroprosthesis for walking, reaching and grasping in more than 100 stroke and spinal cord injured patients. This system has also been used to strengthen muscles and to investigate muscle properties in able-bodied subjects. Compex Motion is a multipurpose FES system specially designed to promote sharing and exchanging of stimulation protocols, sensors, and user interfaces. To the best of our knowledge an FES system that has similar capabilities does not exist yet.},

The physiological background is also elucidated. A cochlear implant consists of an implantable portion which lies within the ear, and of parts that are worn externally on the body. Differences between the first implants and those now in use are as follows: transcutaneous information and energy transmission, the position of the electrode in the ear, and the configuration of the electrode. Differences between the currently available implants mainly concern the number of electrodes, speech coding strategies and the mode of electrode stimulation. Almost all of the most recent implants are equipped with electrodes that are implanted in the tympanic scale of the cochlea.},

An arrange of programmable microcontrollers and DC motors are used in the experimental prototype to generate the reference signals and control the angular position of each joint. In particular, a Network Control System (NCS) is developed and implemented as a dedicated Network using a Controller Area Network (CAN) physical Layer according to the Open System Interconnection (OSI) model. Electronic interface modules were designed and implemented as well, in order to enable the Network Control System to transmit data. In this work, we used one degree of freedom for hip and ankle joints to simplify and mimic the pace when walking straight forward. PID controllers were tuned up for hip, knee and ankle movements, i.e., flexion and extension for hip and knee joints, dorsiflexion and plantarflexion for ankle joint. Experimental results showed good tracking and regulation behavior and good fidelity measure was obtained.},

The robot’s mechanical design, model, safety features, admittance controllers, and the architecture of the haptic controller are presented. Preliminary experiments were planned and performed to evaluate the capability of the system in delivering task-based virtual-reality exercises and trajectory following scenarios.},

The control system is composed of one master controller in charge of commanding the legs servomotors and two proportional Fuzzy controllers, one for each foot, which compute the Center of Pressure (CoP) under each foot and generate a control action to move the hips-ankles servomotors in order to return the CoP to a stable region. Also describes the design and development of a four-point tactile sole which imitates the mechanical and sensing characteristics of human foot skin. Tactile soles are used to generate the CoP trajectories under the feet of the biped robot (Robonova from Hitec brand). Experimental results exhibit a good performance of the proposed cooperative control system for lateral balance.},

The potential possibilities of using FES for performing functional tasks are discussed and the results of preliminary experiments are illustrated. The standing and primitive walking of patient, induced by electrically stimulated paralyzed muscles are presented. Finally, a proposal for an orthotic device using electrical stimulation is described, which enables a paraplegic patient to stand by means of support of his proper bones and muscle forces.},

Initially the oxygen consumption at rest was measured. Then the patients were asked to walk (orthotic gait) at their preferred constant steady speed for a period of 5 minutes. Min. VO2 was measured during the exercise. From these readings the energy cost and consumption of the patients' gait was calculated. Our results show that the ParaWalker allows more efficient walking than do bilateral long leg braces and a paraplegic 3 point gait. It also shows that higher speeds with lower energy cost walking is possible with a different orthotic approach for high or mid thoracic lesion paraplegics. We believe that the energy demands to walk with the ParaWalker are within sustainable limits.},

Up until now oxygen uptake measurement has been the most common method used to assess this. In able bodied subjects heart rate monitoring is also increasingly used. In high thoracic level lesion paraplegics monitoring heart rate was considered to be unreliable because of suspicion of injury to the sympathetic contribution to the cardiac plexus. Bar-On & Nene found that in paraplegics below the lesion level T3 heart rate still shows linear relation to oxygen uptake. MacGregor combined the heart rate and speed of locomotion to produce a single index called physiological cost index. This study consists of monitoring heart rate and speed of 16 adult thoracic level paraplegics walking with the ORLAU ParaWalker, calculation of their physiological cost index, and establishing a range of physiological cost index of paraplegic locomotion using the ORLAU ParaWalker.},

We show that for a particular class of nonlinear systems, they give exactly the same design freedom in distributing the control effort among the actuators. Linear quadratic optimal control is contained as a special case. A benefit of using a separate control allocator is that actuator constraints can be considered, which is illustrated with a flight control example.},

Four channels of electrical stimulation are sufficient for synthesis of a simple reciprocal gait pattern in these patients. During the double-stance phase, knee extensor muscles of both knees are stimulated, providing sufficient support for the body. Only one knee extensor muscle group is excited during the single-stance phase. The swing phase of the contralateral lower extremity is accomplished by eliciting the synergistic flexor muscle response through electrical stimulation of afferent nerves. The transition from the double-stance phase to the swing phase is controlled by two hand switches used by the therapist or built into the handles of the walking frame or crutches for use by the patient.},

A custom distributed embedded system controls the orthosis with power being provided by a lithium polymer battery which provides power for one hour of continuous walking. In order to demonstrate the ability of the orthosis to assist walking, the orthosis was experimentally implemented on a paraplegic subject with a T10 complete injury. Data collected during walking indicates a high degree of step-to-step repeatability of hip and knee trajectories (as enforced by the orthosis) and an average walking speed of 0.8 km/hr. The electrical power required at each hip and knee joint during gait was approximately 25 and 27 W, respectively, contributing to the 117 W overall electrical power required by the device during walking. A video of walking corresponding to the aforementioned data is included in the supplemental material.},

This paper presents the evaluation of Mina with two paraplegics (SCI ASIA-A). We confirmed that with a few hours of training and practice, Mina is currently able to provide paraplegics walking mobility at speeds of up to 0.20 m/s. We further confirmed that using Mina is not physically taxing and requires little cognitive effort, allowing the user to converse and maintain eye contact while walking.},

Unlike kinematic redundancy, actuator redundancy resulting from biarticular actuation brings advantages such as increased stability, reduced link inertia, and decreased nonlinearity of the end-effector force with respect to the force direction. The way the actuator redundancy is resolved is a fundamental problem, as it strongly characterizes robot arms performance. In this study, the six most significant actuation redundancy resolution approaches in the literature-1-norm, 2-norm, infinity-norm, phase different control (PDC), nonlinear hase different control (NLPDC), and linear programming (LP)-are analyzed with respect to their design, and experimentally compared with each other using BiWi, a biarticularly actuated and wire-driven robot arm. In addition, an integrated control framework to resolve actuator redundancy maximizing end-effector force and simultaneously minimizing the necessary input torques is proposed.},

A novel actor–critic–identifier (ACI) is proposed to approximate the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation using three neural network (NN) structures—actor and critic NNs approximate the optimal control and the optimal value function, respectively, and a robust dynamic neural network identifier asymptotically approximates the uncertain system dynamics. An advantage of using the ACI architecture is that learning by the actor, critic, and identifier is continuous and simultaneous, without requiring knowledge of system drift dynamics. Convergence of the algorithm is analyzed using Lyapunov-based adaptive control methods. A persistence of excitation condition is required to guarantee exponential convergence to a bounded region in the neighborhood of the optimal control and uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) stability of the closed-loop system. Simulation results demonstrate the performance of the actor–critic–identifier method for approximate optimal control.},

Typical NN-based controllers yield uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) stability results due to residual functional reconstruction inaccuracies and an inability to compensate for some system disturbances. Several researchers have proposed discontinuous feedback controllers (e.g., variable structure or sliding mode controllers) to reject the residual errors and yield asymptotic results. The research in this paper describes how a recently developed continuous robust integral of the sign of the error (RISE) feedback term can be incorporated with a NN-based feedforward term to achieve semi-global asymptotic tracking. To achieve this result, the typical stability analysis for the RISE method is modified to enable the incorporation of the NN-based feedforward terms, and a projection algorithm is developed to guarantee bounded NN weight estimates.},

The content- addressable memory and other emergent collective properties of the original model also are present in the graded response model. The idea that such collective properties are used in biological systems is given added credence by the continued presence of such properties for more nearly biological "neurons." Collective analog electrical circuits of the kind described will certainly function. The collective states of the two models have a simple correspondence. The original model will continue to be useful for simulations, because its connection to graded response systems is established. Equations that include the effect of action potentials in the graded response system are also developed.},

As such, an assistive controller that provides walking assistance without dictating the spatiotemporal nature of joint movement is described here. Following a description of the control laws and finite state structure of the controller, the authors present the results of an experimental implementation and preliminary validation of the control approach, in which the control architecture was implemented on a lower limb exoskeleton, and the exoskeleton implemented in an experimental protocol on three subjects with hemiparesis following stroke. In a series of sessions in which each patient used the exoskeleton, all patients showed substantial single-session improvements in all measured gait outcomes, presumably as a result of using the assistive controller and exoskeleton.},

Being based on a policy iteration technique, the algorithm alternates between the policy evaluation and policy update steps until an update of the control policy will no longer improve the system performance. The result is a direct adaptive control algorithm which converges to the optimal control solution without using an explicit, a priori obtained, model of the system internal dynamics.

NZS games allow for players to have a cooperative team component and an individual selfish component of strategy. The adaptive algorithm learns online the solution of coupled Riccati equations and coupled Hamilton–Jacobi equations for linear and nonlinear systems respectively. This adaptive control method finds in real-time approximations of the optimal value and the NZS Nash-equilibrium, while also guaranteeing closed-loop stability. The optimal-adaptive algorithm is implemented as a separate actor/critic parametric network approximator structure for every player, and involves simultaneous continuous-time adaptation of the actor/critic networks. A persistence of excitation condition is shown to guarantee convergence of every critic to the actual optimal value function for that player. A detailed mathematical analysis is done for 2-player NZS games. Novel tuning algorithms are given for the actor/critic networks. The convergence to the Nash equilibrium is proven and stability of the system is also guaranteed. This provides optimal adaptive control solutions for both non-zero-sum games and their special case, the zero-sum games. Simulation examples show the effectiveness of the new algorithm.},

The characteristics and stage of development of four systems were detailed: the Louiiana State University reciprocating gait orthosis (LSU-RGO) with muscle stimulation; the modular hybrid functional neuromuscular stimulation (FNS) orthosis; the Cleveland VA-Case Western Reserve University (VA-CWRU) implant system; and the Parastep system. Multicenter clinical trials are underway for the Parastep system and are planned to start within the next 2 years for the LSU-RGO with muscle stimulation, the VA-CWRU 8-channel system, and the floor reaction orthosis component of the modular hybrid FNS system. Current investigational systems provide little advantage over the standing wheelchair in some occupations but they do expand social, recreational, and exercise capabilities. Disabled people and some leading rehabilitation physicians are willing to test basic ambulation devices but the regulatory approvals must first be obtained for multicenter clinical trials. Corporate partners are central to the development of devices, their clinical testing, and their subsequent marketing. A key requirement for developing and disseminating motor prostheses is the education of clinicians so that they will participate in trials and be prepared to prescribe the prostheses when they reach the market.},

A description of advances in FES technologies, with an emphasis on systems designed to promote LE function is included, and mechanisms that may be associated with the observed therapeutic effects are discussed. Eligible studies were reviewed for methodological quality, population, intervention and outcome characteristics. Therapeutic effects of FES were consistently demonstrated at the body function and activity levels when it was used as a training modality. Compared to matched treatments that did not incorporate FES, no definite conclusions can be drawn regarding the superiority of FES. When FES was used as an alternative to an orthotic device, it had no superior therapeutic effects at the activity level, yet patients still seemed to prefer it.},

   abstract = {This paper presents a tele-impedance based assistive control scheme for a knee exoskeleton device. The proposed controller captures the user’s intent to generate task-related assistive torques by means of the exoskeleton in different phases of the subject’s normal activity. To do so, a detailed musculoskeletal model of the human knee is developed and experimentally calibrated to best match the user’s kinematic and dynamic behavior. Three dominant antagonistic muscle pairs are used in our model, in which electromyography (EMG) signals are acquired, processed and used for the estimation of the knee joint torque, trajectory and the stiffness trend, in real time. The estimated stiffness trend is then scaled and mapped to a task-related stiffness interval to agree with the desired degree of assistance. The desired stiffness and equilibrium trajectories are then tracked by the exoskeleton’s impedance controller. As a consequence, while minimum muscular activity corresponds to low stiffness, i.e. highly transparent motion, higher co-contractions result in a stiffer joint and a greater level of assistance. To evaluate the robustness of the proposed technique, a study of the dynamics of the human-exoskeleton system is conducted, while the stability in the steady state and transient condition is investigated. In addition, experimental results of standing-up and sitting-down tasks are demonstrated to further investigate the capabilities of the controller. The results indicate that the compliant knee exoskeleton, incorporating the proposed tele-impedance controller, can effectively generate assistive actions that are volitionally and intuitively controlled by the user’s muscle activity.},

The nonlinear estimator is robust to uncertainties in the motion modeling and sensor noise/bias from the IMUs.

The error between the rotor flux linkages based on a neural network model and a voltage model is back propagated to adjust the weights of the neural network model for the rotor resistance estimation. For the stator resistance estimation, the error between the measured stator current and the estimated stator current using neural network is back propagated to adjust the weights of the neural network. The rotor speed is synthesized from the induction motor state equations. The performance of the stator and rotor resistance estimators and torque and flux responses of the drive, together with these estimators, are investigated with the help of simulations for variations in the stator and rotor resistances from their nominal values. Both resistances are estimated experimentally, using the proposed neural network in a vector controlled induction motor drive. Data on tracking performances of these estimators are presented. With this speed sensorless approach, the rotor resistance estimation was made insensitive to the stator resistance variations both in simulation and experiment. The accuracy of the estimated speed achieved experimentally, without the speed sensor clearly demonstrates the reliable and high-performance operation of the drive},

   abstract = {Many rehabilitation robots use electric motors with gears. The backdrivability of geared drives is poor due to friction. While it is common practice to use velocity measurements to compensate for kinetic friction, breakaway friction usually cannot be compensated for without the use of an additional force sensor that directly measures the interaction force between the human and the robot. Therefore, in robots without force sensors, subjects must overcome a large breakaway torque to initiate user-driven movements, which are important for motor learning. In this technical note, a new methodology to compensate for both kinetic and breakaway friction is presented. The basic strategy is to take advantage of the fact that, for rehabilitation exercises, the direction of the desired motion is often known. By applying the new method to three implementation examples, including drives with gear reduction ratios 100-435, the peak breakaway torque could be reduced by 60-80%.},

   abstract = {Critically ill patients often experience stress-induced hyperglycaemia, which results in increased morbidity and mortality. Glycaemic control (GC) can be implemented in the intensive care unit (ICU) to safely manage hyperglycaemia. Two protocols SPRINT and STAR, have been implemented in the Christchurch ICU, and have been successful in treating hyperglycaemia while decreasing the risk of hypoglycaemia. This paper presents a new GC protocol that implements the probabilistic, stochastic forecasting methods of STAR, while formalizing the control methodology using model predictive control (MPC) theory to improve the ability to tune the dynamic response of the controller. This Stochastic Model Predictive (STOMP) controller predicts the response to a given insulin/nutrition intervention, and attributes weighted penalty values to several key performance metrics. The controller thus chooses an intervention at each hour that minimizes the sum of these penalties over a prediction window of 6h, which is twice as long as the 3-h window used in STAR. Clinically validated virtual trials were used to evaluate the relative performance of STOMP. Results showed STOMP was able to obtain results very similar to STAR with both protocols maintaining approximately 85% of time within 4.4–8.0mmol/L glycaemic band, and only 4–5 patients of the 149 patient STAR cohort having blood glucose (BG) <2.2mmol/L. STOMP was able to attain similar results to STAR while further increasing ease of controller tuning for different clinical requirements and reducing the number of BG measurements required by 35%.},

   abstract = {Robotic and functional electrical stimulation (FES) approaches are used for rehabilitation of walking impairment of spinal cord injured individuals. Although devices are commercially available, there are still issues that remain to be solved. Control of hybrid exoskeletons aims at blending robotic exoskeletons and electrical stimulation to overcome the drawbacks of each approach while preserving their advantages. Hybrid actuation and control have a considerable potential for walking rehabilitation but there is a need of novel control strategies of hybrid systems that adequately manage the balance between FES and robotic controllers. Combination of FES and robotic control is a challenging issue, due to the non-linear behavior of muscle under stimulation and the lack of developments in the field of hybrid control. In this article, a cooperative control strategy of a hybrid exoskeleton is presented. This strategy is designed to overcome the main disadvantages of muscular stimulation: electromechanical delay and change in muscle performance over time, and to balance muscular and robotic actuation during walking.Experimental results in healthy subjects show the ability of the hybrid FES-robot cooperative control to balance power contribution between exoskeleton and muscle stimulation. The robotic exoskeleton decreases assistance while adequate knee kinematics are guaranteed. A new technique to monitor muscle performance is employed, which allows to estimate muscle fatigue and implement muscle fatigue management strategies. Kinesis is therefore the first ambulatory hybrid exoskeleton that can effectively balance robotic and FES actuation during walking. This represents a new opportunity to implement new rehabilitation interventions to induce locomotor activity in patients with paraplegia.Acronym list: 10 mWT: ten meters walking test; 6 MWT: six minutes walking test; FSM: finite-state machine; t-FSM: time-domain FSM; c-FSM: cycle-domain FSM; FES: functional electrical stimulation; HKAFO: hip-knee-ankle-foot orthosis; ILC: iterative error-based learning control; MFE: muscle fatigue estimator; NILC: Normalized stimulation output from ILC controller; PID: Proportional-Integral-derivative Control; PW: Stimulation pulse width; QUEST: Quebec User Evaluation of Satisfaction with assistive Technology; SCI: Spinal cord injury; TTI: torque-time integral; VAS: Visual Analog Scale.},

   abstract = {The input-constrained LQR problem is addressed in this paper; i.e., the problem of finding the optimal control law for a linear system such that a quadratic cost functional is minimised over a horizon of length N subject to the satisfaction of input constraints. A global solution (i.e., valid in the entire state space) for this problem, and for arbitrary horizon N, is derived analytically by using dynamic programming. The scalar input case is considered in this paper. Solutions to this problem (and to more general problems: state constraints, multiple inputs) have been reported recently in the literature, for example, approaches that use the geometric structure of the underlying quadratic programming problem and approaches that use multi-parametric quadratic programming techniques. The solution by dynamic programming proposed in the present paper coincides with the ones obtained by the aforementioned approaches. However, being derived using a different approach that exploits the dynamic nature of the constrained optimisation problem to obtain an analytical solution, the present result complements the previous methods and reveals additional insights into the intrinsic structure of the optimal solution.},

   abstract = {For discrete-time linear time invariant systems with constraints on inputs and states, we develop an algorithm to determine explicitly, the state feedback control law which minimizes a quadratic performance criterion. We show that the control law is piece-wise linear and continuous for both the finite horizon problem (model predictive control) and the usual infinite time measure (constrained linear quadratic regulation). Thus, the on-line control computation reduces to the simple evaluation of an explicitly defined piecewise linear function. By computing the inherent underlying controller structure, we also solve the equivalent of the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation for discrete-time linear constrained systems. Control based on on-line optimization has long been recognized as a superior alternative for constrained systems. The technique proposed in this paper is attractive for a wide range of practical problems where the computational complexity of on-line optimization is prohibitive. It also provides an insight into the structure underlying optimization-based controllers.},

   abstract = {This paper is intended to show the comparison of two closed-loop controllers performances for a catalytic reverse flow reactor (RFR): a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) and a model predictive control (MPC) strategy that both use a high-gain observer. The aim of the RFR is to reduce, by catalytic reaction, the amount of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released in the atmosphere. The particularity of this process is that the gas flow inside the reactor is periodically reversed in order to trap the heat released during the reaction inside the process. Very few papers are dealing with the control of the RFR. The new multivariable optimal control issue tackled here is to confine the hot spot temperature within two temperature limits, in order to ensure complete conversion of the pollutant and to prevent catalyst overheating, while optimizing the process yield and the consumption of electrical power. Both control laws aim to optimize the tuning of the dilution and the internal electric heating. The model considered here for control of the RFR is obtained from a countercurrent pseudo-homogeneous partial differential equation (PDE) model. The feed concentration (acting as an important input disturbance) and the temperature profile in the RFR are estimated on-line using a high-gain observer based on three temperatures measurements. In order to maintain the safe use of the reactor, the estimate state is injected in the LQR whereas the MPC is based on the estimated input disturbance. Simulation results allow comparing performances of the LQR and the MPC.},

   abstract = {Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engines provide a possible solution for affordable, efficient and clean-burning power sources for either stationary power generator or advanced vehicles. In fact, HCCI engines integrate the advantages of both the spark ignition (SI) and compression ignition (CI) engines: (i) high fuel efficiency resulting from high compression ratio and rapid heat release and (ii) low NOx and low particulate matter (PM) emissions due to low cylinder peak temperature. Control of the HCCI engine, however, is difficult since its ignition cannot be directly actuated. The autoignition timing of HCCI combustion is determined by the cylinder charge conditions, rather than the spark timing or the fuel injection timing that are used to initiate combustion in SI and CI engines, respectively. Instead, controlled autoignition requires regulation of the charge properties, especially charge temperature, as demonstrated by many experimental results. Moreover, in order to realize the HCCI technology, several constraints in the system need to be considered. First, the combustion rate or cylinder pressure gradient should be constrained to avoid knocking. Since point-wise in time constraints in the combustion rate is needed constrained control will be necessary for the fuel and rebreathing lift commands. Second, the actuator constrains such as the limit range of the valve lift should also be explicitly take into account. For the purpose of model-based control development, we intend to first develop a HCCI engine model by extending a single cylinder HCCI engine model. The existence of a physics-based engine model, pointwise-in-time constraints and multiple actuators motivate the application of model-based optimization-control approaches such as Model Predictive Control (MPC). The model is used to predict the behavior of the system over a future horizon and an optimization-based methodology ensures optimal performance and satisfaction of constraints.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) allow direct translation of electric, magnetic or metabolic brain signals into control commands of external devices such as robots, prostheses or exoskeletons. However, non-stationarity of brain signals and susceptibility to biological or environmental artifacts impede reliable control and safety of BMIs, particularly in daily life environments. Here we introduce and tested a novel hybrid brain-neural computer interaction (BNCI) system fusing electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG) to enhance reliability and safety of continuous hand exoskeleton-driven grasping motions.

FINDINGS: 12 healthy volunteers (8 male, mean age 28.1 ± 3.63y) used EEG (condition #1) and hybrid EEG/EOG (condition #2) signals to control a hand exoskeleton. Motor imagery-related brain activity was translated into exoskeleton-driven hand closing motions. Unintended motions could be interrupted by eye movement-related EOG signals. In order to evaluate BNCI control and safety, participants were instructed to follow a visual cue indicating either to move or not to move the hand exoskeleton in a random order. Movements exceeding 25% of a full grasping motion when the device was not supposed to be moved were defined as safety violation. While participants reached comparable control under both conditions, safety was frequently violated under condition #1 (EEG), but not under condition #2 (EEG/EOG).

CONCLUSION: EEG/EOG biosignal fusion can substantially enhance safety of assistive BNCI systems improving their applicability in daily life environments.},

Perhaps the most frequently encountered estimation problem is the estimation of the mean of a signal in noise. In many parameter estimation problems the situation is more complicated because direct access to the data necessary to estimate the parameters is impossible, or some of the data are missing. Such difficulties arise when an outcome is a result of an accumulation of simpler outcomes, or when outcomes are clumped together, for example, in a binning or histogram operation. There may also be data dropouts or clustering in such a way that the number of underlying data points is unknown (censoring and/or truncation). The EM (expectation-maximization) algorithm is ideally suited to problems of this sort, in that it produces maximum-likelihood (ML) estimates of parameters when there is a many-to-one mapping from an underlying distribution to the distribution governing the observation. The EM algorithm is presented at a level suitable for signal processing practitioners who have had some exposure to estimation theory},

There is currently a lack of standard for reporting joint motion in the field of biomechanics for human movement, and the JCS as proposed by Grood and Suntay has the advantage of reporting joint motions in clinically relevant terms. In this communication, the STC proposes definitions of JCS for the ankle, hip, and spine. Definitions for other joints (such as shoulder, elbow, hand and wrist, temporomandibular joint (TMJ), and whole body) will be reported in later parts of the series. The STC is publishing these recommendations so as to encourage their use, to stimulate feedback and discussion, and to facilitate further revisions. For each joint, a standard for the local axis system in each articulating bone is generated. These axes then standardize the JCS. Adopting these standards will lead to better communication among researchers and clinicians.},

   abstract = {Gait analysis methods to estimate spatiotemporal measures, based on two, three or four gyroscopes attached on lower limbs have been discussed in the literature. The most common approach to reduce the number of sensing units is to simplify the underlying biomechanical gait model. In this study, we propose a novel method based on prediction of movements of thighs from movements of shanks. Datasets from three previous studies were used. Data from the first study (ten healthy subjects and ten with Parkinson's disease) were used to develop and calibrate a system with only two gyroscopes attached on shanks. Data from two other studies (36 subjects with hip replacement, seven subjects with coxarthrosis, and eight control subjects) were used for comparison with the other methods and for assessment of error compared to a motion capture system. Results show that the error of estimation of stride length compared to motion capture with the system with four gyroscopes and our new method based on two gyroscopes was close ( -0.8 ±6.6 versus 3.8 ±6.6 cm). An alternative with three sensing units did not show better results (error: -0.2 ±8.4 cm). Finally, a fourth that also used two units but with a simpler gait model had the highest bias compared to the reference (error: -25.6 ±7.6 cm). We concluded that it is feasible to estimate movements of thighs from movements of shanks to reduce number of needed sensing units from 4 to 2 in context of ambulatory gait analysis.},

   abstract = {In this study we describe an ambulatory system for estimation of spatio-temporal parameters during long periods of walking. This original method based on wavelet analysis is proposed to compute the values of temporal gait parameters from the angular velocity of lower limbs. Based on a mechanical model, the medio-lateral rotation of the lower limbs during stance and swing, the stride length and velocity are estimated by integration of the angular velocity. Measurement's accuracy was assessed using as a criterion standard the information provided by foot pressure sensors. To assess the accuracy of the method on a broad range of performance for each gait parameter, we gathered data from young and elderly subjects. No significant error was observed for toe-off detection, while a slight systematic delay (10ms on average) existed between heelstrike obtained from gyroscopes and footswitch. There was no significant difference between actual spatial parameters (stride length and velocity) and their estimated values. Errors for velocity and stride length estimations were 0.06m/s and 0.07m, respectively. This system is light, portable, inexpensive and does not provoke any discomfort to subjects. It can be carried for long periods of time, thus providing new longitudinal information such as stride-to-stride variability of gait. Several clinical applications can be proposed such as outcome evaluation after total knee or hip replacement, external prosthesis adjustment for amputees, monitoring of rehabilitation progress, gait analysis in neurological diseases, and fall risk estimation in elderly.

   abstract = {Wearable robots are expected to expand the use of robotics in rehabilitation since they can widen the assistance application context. An important aspect of a rehabilitation therapy, in terms of lower extremity assistance, is balance control. In this article, we propose and evaluate an adaptive control strategy for robotic rehabilitation therapies to guarantee static stability using a wearable robot. Postural balance control can be implemented either acting on the hip, on the ankle joint or on both, depending on the kind of perturbation acting on the subject: internal or external. Internal perturbations can be produced by any voluntary movement of the body, such as bending the trunk. External perturbations, in the form of an impact force, are applied by the exoskeleton without any prior notice to observe the proactive response of the subject. We have used a 6 degree of freedom planar lower limb exoskeleton, H1, to perform this analysis. The developed control strategy has been designed to provide the necessary assistance, related to balance recovery and postural stability, under the “Assist-as-needed” paradigm. The interaction forces between orthosis and subject are monitored, as they play a relevant role in the definition of assistive and resistive movements to be applied to the joints. The proposed method has been tested with 5 healthy subjects in presence of internal and external disturbances. The results demonstrate that knowing the stability limit of each subject, in combination with a therapeutically selected scaling factor, the proposed adaptive control helps in providing an effective assistance in therapy. This method is efficient in handling the individual and combined effect of external perturbations acting on any joint movements.},

Along with the description of its mechatronic modules, we report the experimental characterization of the performance of the actuation and control system, as well as the usability test carried out with a healthy subject. Results showed a suitable dynamic behavior of the actuation unit: the closed-loop torque control bandwidth is about 15 Hz and the output impedance ranges from about 1 N m/rad to 35 N m/rad in the frequency spectrum between 0.2 and 3.2 Hz. Results from the tests with the healthy subject proved the overall system usability: the subject could walk with the device without being hindered and while he received a smooth assistive flexion–extension torque profile on both hip articulations.},

This is a Lyapunov-based approach in which a Lyapunov function chosen a priori is decreased, not continuously, but discretely; it is allowed to increase at other times. We show in this work that the implementation of this additional constraint into the online optimization makes it possible to prove strong nominal stability properties of the closed-loop system},

   abstract = {The usual way to guarantee stability of model predictive control (MPC) strategies is based on a terminal cost function and a terminal constraint region. This note analyzes the stability of MPC when the terminal constraint is removed. This is particularly interesting when the system is unconstrained on the state. In this case, the computational burden of the optimization problem does not have to be increased by introducing terminal state constraints due to stabilizing reasons. A region in which the terminal constraint can be removed from the optimization problem is characterized depending on some of the design parameters of MPC. This region is a domain of attraction of the MPC without terminal constraint. Based on this result, it is proved that weighting the terminal cost, this domain of attraction of the MPC controller without terminal constraint is enlarged reaching (practically) the same domain of attraction of the MPC with terminal constraint; moreover, a practical procedure to calculate the stabilizing weighting factor for a given initial state is shown. Finally, these results are extended to the case of suboptimal solutions and an asymptotically stabilizing suboptimal controller without terminal constraint is presented.},

A nonquadratic cost function is considered, and constraints are imposed on both the state and control vectors. Two main contributions are reported. The first consists in deriving a stabilizing regulator by adding a proper terminal penalty function to the process cost. The control vector is generated by means of a feedback control law computed off line instead of computing it on line, as is done for existing RH regulators. The off-line computation is performed by approximating the RH regulator by means of a multilayer feedforward neural network (this is the second contribution of the paper). Bounds to this approximation are established. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

   abstract = {It is well known that unconstrained infinite-horizon optimal control may be used to construct a stabilizing controller for a nonlinear system. We show that similar stabilization results may be achieved using unconstrained finite horizon optimal control. The key idea is to approximate the tail of the infinite horizon cost-to-go using, as terminal cost, an appropriate control Lyapunov function. Roughly speaking, the terminal control Lyapunov function (CLF) should provide an (incremental) upper bound on the cost. In this fashion, important stability characteristics may be retained without the use of terminal constraints such as those employed by a number of other researchers. The absence of constraints allows a significant speedup in computation. Furthermore, it is shown that in order to guarantee stability, it suffices to satisfy an improvement property, thereby relaxing the requirement that truly optimal trajectories be found. We provide a complete analysis of the stability and region of attraction/operation properties of receding horizon control strategies that utilize finite horizon approximations in the proposed class. It is shown that the guaranteed region of operation contains that of the CLF controller and may be made as large as desired by increasing the optimization horizon (restricted, of course, to the infinite horizon domain). Moreover, it is easily seen that both CLF and infinite-horizon optimal control approaches are limiting cases of our receding horizon strategy. The key results are illustrated using a familiar example, the inverted pendulum, where significant improvements in guaranteed region of operation and cost are noted},

INTERVENTION: Thirty-two functional neuromuscular stimulation ambulation training sessions using a commercially available system (Parastep-1). The hybrid system consists of a microprocessor-controlled stimulator and a modified walking frame with finger-operated switches that permit the user to control the stimulation parameters and activate the stepping. OUTCOME MEASURES: Distance walked, time spent standing and walking, pace, circumferential (shoulders, chest, abdomen, waist, hips, upper arm, thigh, and calf) and skinfold (chest, triceps, axilla, subscapular, supraillium, abdomen, and thigh) measurements, body weight, thigh cross-sectional area, and calculated lean tissue. RESULTS: Statistically significant changes in distance, time standing and walking, and pace were found. Increases in thigh and calf girth, thigh cross-sectional area, and calculated lean tissue, as well as a decrease in thigh skinfold measure, were all statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The Parastep 1 system enables persons with thoracic-level spinal cord injuries to stand and ambulate short distances but with a high degree of performance variability across individuals. The factors that influence this variability have not been completely identified.},

   abstract = {A minimal set of muscles (8 to 16) were identified as candidates for implantation in a clinical system to provide walking function to individuals with complete paraplegia using functional electrical stimulation (FES). Three subjects with complete motor and sensory paraplegia had percutaneous intramuscular electrodes implanted in all major muscles controlling the trunk, hips, knees, and ankles. Stimulation patterns for walking with FES were generated for different sets of eight and 16 muscles. The quality and repeatability of the resulting gait produced by walking patterns consisting of various combinations of muscles were determined. Most eight-channel stimulation patterns resulted in scissoring or insufficient hip flexion, preventing forward progression. One eight-channel system allowed a maximum speed of 0.1 m/s with a cadence of 22 steps/min and a stride length less than 0.3 m. Improved walking performance was observed with 16 channels of stimulation. This ranged from slow step- to gait at 0.1 m/s to smooth reciprocal gait at 0.5 m/s. In all three subjects, the favored combination of 16 channels included erector spinae for trunk extension; gluteus maximus, posterior portion of adductor magnus and hamstrings for hip extension; tensor fasciae latae and either sartorius or iliopsoas for hip flexion; vastus lateralis/intermedius for knee extension; and tibialis anterior/peroneous longus for ankle dorsiflexion. In one subject the 16-channel FES system provided repeatable day-to-day gait averaging 0.4 m/s, 58 steps/min and a stride length at 0.8 m. A maximum repeatable walking distance with 16 channels was 34 m. Multiple 34-m trials were possible with minimal rests between walks. Fatigue of both the hip extensors and upper body was a limiting factor. The selection of target muscles for implantation is critical to the performance of FES systems. This study provides guidelines to muscle selection for walking with FES based on objective measures of gait performance. The findings indicate that a 16-channel FES system for total implantation is feasible for repeatable short distance, independent, walker-support walking in paraplegia.},

A nonlinear control method is developed to control the human quadriceps femoris muscle undergoing nonisometric contractions. The developed controller does not require a muscle model and can be proven to yield asymptotic stability for a nonlinear muscle model in the presence of bounded nonlinear disturbances (e.g., spasticity, delays, fatigue). The performance of the controller is demonstrated through a series of closed-loop experiments on human subjects. The experiments illustrate the ability of the controller to enable the leg shank to track single and multiple period trajectories with different periods and ranges of motion, and also track desired step changes with changing loads.},

This implies that a trajectory designed or recorded from the normal human walking data may not be the best choice for tracking control. Another major challenge during FES-based walking is the rapid onset of muscle fatigue. Two methods to reduce fatigue during FES-based walking are employing an orthosis and minimizing muscle activations. To deal with these aforementioned challenges, this paper presents firstly a dynamic model representing FES-elicited walking constrained by an orthosis and a walker. Secondly, this paper deals with the design of optimal stimulation and force profiles (instead of gait-trajectories from able-bodied humans) that minimize muscle activations via FES and arm reaction forces from the walker. Ten walking steps are simulated to show the feasibility of the walking model and optimization algorithm.},

   abstract = {With efficiencies derived from evolution, growth and learning, humans are very well-tuned for locomotion. Metabolic energy used during walking can be partly replaced by power input from an exoskeleton, but is it possible to reduce metabolic rate without providing an additional energy source? This would require an improvement in the efficiency of the human-machine system as a whole, and would be remarkable given the apparent optimality of human gait. Here we show that the metabolic rate of human walking can be reduced by an unpowered ankle exoskeleton. We built a lightweight elastic device that acts in parallel with the user's calf muscles, off-loading muscle force and thereby reducing the metabolic energy consumed in contractions. The device uses a mechanical clutch to hold a spring as it is stretched and relaxed by ankle movements when the foot is on the ground, helping to fulfil one function of the calf muscles and Achilles tendon. Unlike muscles, however, the clutch sustains force passively. The exoskeleton consumes no chemical or electrical energy and delivers no net positive mechanical work, yet reduces the metabolic cost of walking by 7.2 [plusmn] 2.6% for healthy human users under natural conditions, comparable to savings with powered devices. Improving upon walking economy in this way is analogous to altering the structure of the body such that it is more energy-effective at walking. While strong natural pressures have already shaped human locomotion, improvements in efficiency are still possible. Much remains to be learned about this seemingly simple behaviour.},

   abstract = {To control movements aided by functional electrical stimulation (FES) in paraplegic patients, stimulation of the paralyzed lower limbs might be adjusted in response to voluntary upper body effort. Recently, Donaldson and Yu proposed a theoretical approach, called "control by handle reactions of leg muscle stimulation" (CHRELMS), in which stimulation of the lower limbs depends on upper body effort, i.e., body posture and recorded hand reactions, and is aimed to minimize arm forces during standing up and standing. An alternative strategy is presented in this paper, which accounts for voluntary upper body effort as well, but does not require estimation of hand reactions. The objective of this study is to test both strategies by applying them to a generic two-dimensional (2-D) neuromusculoskeletal model. The model takes into account the major properties of muscle and segmental dynamics during FES-supported standing-up movements of a paraplegic patient. In comparison to standing up without FES-support, both closed-loop strategies yield satisfying standing-up movements although no reference information (e.g., a desired trajectory) is required. Arm forces can be significantly reduced. Using the model to optimize the controller, time-consuming and strenuous trial-and-error experimentation could be avoided. However, final experimental studies are planned to verify the presented strategies.},

Barriers to the development of NMES controllers exist because the muscle response to an electrical stimulation is nonlinear and the muscle model is uncertain. Efforts in this paper focus on the development of an adaptive inverse optimal NMES controller. The controller yields desired limb trajectory tracking while simultaneously minimizing a cost functional that is positive in the error states and stimulation input. The development of this framework allows tradeoffs to be made between tracking performance and control effort by putting different penalties on error states and control input, depending on the clinical goal or functional task. The controller is examined through a Lyapunov-based analysis. Experiments on able-bodied individuals are provided to demonstrate the performance of the developed controller.},

A new predictor-based closed-loop controller called proportional integral derivative controller with delay compensation (PID-DC) is presented in this paper. The PID-DC controller was designed to compensate for EMDs during NMES. Further, the robust controller can be implemented despite uncertainties or in the absence of model knowledge of the nonlinear musculoskeletal dynamics. Lyapunov stability analysis was used to synthesize the new controller. The control effectiveness of the new controller was validated and compared with two recently developed nonlinear NMES controllers, through a series of closed-loop control experiments on four able-bodied human subjects. Experimental results depict statistically significant improved performance with PID-DC. The new controller is shown to be robust to variations in an estimated EMD value.},

   abstract = {In this paper, a fully automatic robust control strategy is proposed for control of paraplegic pedaling using functional electrical stimulation (FES). The method is based on higher-order sliding mode (HOSM) control and fuzzy logic control. In FES, the strength of muscle contraction can be altered either by varying the pulse width (PW) or by the pulse amplitude (PA) of the stimulation signal. The proposed control strategy regulates simultaneously both PA and PW (i.e., PA/PW modulation). A HOSM controller is designed for regulating the PW and a fuzzy logic controller for the PA. The proposed control scheme is free-model and does not require any offline training phase and subject-specific information. Simulation studies on a virtual patient and experiments on three paraplegic subjects demonstrate good tracking performance and robustness of the proposed control strategy against muscle fatigue and external disturbances during FES-induced pedaling. The results of simulation studies show that the power and cadence tracking errors are 5.4% and 4.8%, respectively. The experimental results indicate that the proposed controller can improve pedaling system efficacy and increase the endurance of FES pedaling. The average of power tracking error over three paraplegic subjects is 7.4±1.4% using PA/PW modulation, while the tracking error is 10.2±1.2% when PW modulation is used. The subjects could pedal for 15 min with about 4.1% power loss at the end of experiment using proposed control strategy, while the power loss is 14.3% using PW modulation. The controller could adjust the stimulation intensity to compensate the muscle fatigue during long period of FES pedaling.},

   abstract = {This paper describes a hybrid system that combines a powered lower limb exoskeleton with functional electrical stimulation (FES) for gait restoration in persons with paraplegia. The general control structure consists of two control loops: a motor control loop, which utilizes joint angle feedback control to control the output of the joint motor to track the desired joint trajectories, and a muscle control loop, which utilizes joint torque profiles from previous steps to shape the muscle stimulation profile for the subsequent step in order to minimize the motor torque contribution required for joint angle trajectory tracking. The implementation described here incorporates stimulation of the hamstrings and quadriceps muscles, such that the hip joints are actuated by the combination of hip motors and the hamstrings, and the knee joints are actuated by the combination of knee motors and the quadriceps. In order to demonstrate efficacy, the control approach was implemented on three paraplegic subjects with motor complete spinal cord injuries ranging from levels T6 to T10. Experimental data indicates that the cooperative control system provided consistent and repeatable gait motions and reduced the torque and power output required from the hip and knee motors of the exoskeleton compared to walking without FES.},

   abstract = {Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is commonly used in rehabilitative settings and is also used for assistive purposes to create functional movements, where it is termed functional electrical stimulation (FES). One limitation of NMES/FES is early onset of muscle fatigue. NMES-induced fatigue can be reduced by switching between multiple stimulation channels that target different motor units or synergistic muscles (i.e., asynchronous stimulation). However, switching stimulation channels introduces additional complexity due to the need to consider the switching dynamics and differing muscle response to stimulation. The objective of this study was to develop and test a closed-loop controller for asynchronous stimulation. The developed closed-loop controller yields asymptotic tracking of a desired trajectory for a person's knee-shank complex despite switching between stimulation channels. The developed controller was implemented on four able-bodied individuals with four-channel asynchronous stimulation as well as single-channel conventional stimulation. The results indicate that asynchronous stimulation extends the duration that functional movements can be performed during feedback control. This result is promising for the implementation of asynchronous stimulation in closedloop rehabilitative procedures and in assistive devices as a method to reduce muscle fatigue while maintaining a person's ability to track a desired limb trajectory.},

   abstract = {A simple and inexpensive photographic method has been developed whereby many kinematic components of the walking act in the sagittal, frontal, and transverse planes can be measured and related temporally. A factorial design was used to study the displacement patterns of sixty normal men who ranged in age from twenty to sixty-five years and in height from sixty-one to seventy-four inches. Each subject's weight was within normal limits for his height and frame size. There was striking similarity in the duration of successive phases of stance, swing, and double-limb support during the same walking trial and during repeated trials of the same subject. Step and stride length and stride width showed the same striking similarity. Foot angles, however, showed greater individual variability. The differences in timing and stride dimensions did not relate systematically with age. However, the subjects sixty to sixty-five years old differed from younger subjects in that they took shorter steps and strides and showed a greater degree of out-toeing. The only variables which related systematically with height were the step and stride lengths, with the tall subjects taking the longest steps and strides and the short subjects, the shortest. Seven displacement patterns of free-cadence walking were analyzed for sixty normal men from twenty to sixty-five years old and from sixty-one to seventy-four inches tall. These displacement patterns include sagittal rotation of the pelvis, hip, knee, and ankle and vertical, lateral, and forward movement of the trunk. Each movement pattern was strikingly similar for repeated trials of the same subject and for subjects in the various age and height groups. Slight differences in the magnitude of hip flexion excursion occurred, which showed a low positive correlation with age and a similarly low but negative correlation with height. There was no evidence of presenile changes in these excursions among our oldest subjects, except for some decrease in the magnitude of ankle extension at the end of the stance phase. The serial transverse rotations of the pelvis and thorax have been analyzed in free-cadence walking of sixty normal men. Although there was striking similarity in these excursions for repeated trials of the same subject, there was wide variation in these excursions among the subjects in similar age and height categories. These variations suggest that pelvic and thoracic rotation are not obligatory elements of normal gait. The decreased pelvic rotation in the group sixty to sixty-five years old may possibly represent another aspect of the presenile pattern of walking.},

   abstract = {Methods are described for estimating the inertia, viscosity, and stiffness of the lower leg around the knee and of the whole leg around the hip that are applicable even to persons with considerable spasticity. These involve: 1) a "pull" test in which the limb is slowly moved throughout its range of motion while measuring angles (with an electrogoniometer) and torques (with a hand-held dynamometer) to determine passive stiffness and 2) a "pendulum" test in which the limb is moved against gravity and then dropped, while again measuring angles and torques. By limiting the extent of the movement and choosing a direction (flexion or extension) that minimizes reflex responses, the mechanical parameters can be determined accurately and efficiently using computer programs. In the sample of subjects studied (nine with disability related to spinal cord injury, head injury, or stroke, and nine with no neurological disability), the inertia of the lower leg was significantly reduced in the subjects with disability (p < 0.05) as a result of atrophy, but the stiffness and viscosity were within normal limits. The values of inertia were also compared with anthropometric data in the literature. The identification of these passive parameters is particularly important in designing systems for functional electrical stimulation of paralyzed muscles, but the methods may be widely applicable in rehabilitation medicine.},

The scheme can be applied to both stable and unstable systems with input constraints. The objective functional to be minimized consists of an integral square error (ISE) part over a finite time horizon plus a quadratic terminal cost. The terminal state penalty matrix of the terminal cost term has to be chosen as the solution of an appropriate Lyapunov equation. Furthermore, the setup includes a terminal inequality constraint that forces the states at the end of the finite prediction horizon to lie within a prescribed terminal region. If the Jacobian linearization of the nonlinear system to be controlled is stabilizable, we prove that feasibility of the open-loop optimal control problem at time t=0 implies asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system. The size of the region of attraction is only restricted by the requirement for feasibility of the optimization problem due to the input and terminal inequality constraints and is thus maximal in some sense.},

A discrete-time model is used to characterize the relationship between stimulus parameters and muscle activation. A Hill-based model of the musculotendon actuator accounts for nonlinear static and dynamic properties of both muscle and tendon. Muscle fatigue and passive muscle viscosity are modeled in detail. Moment arms are computed from musculotendon paths of 13 actuators and from joint geometry. The model also takes nonlinear body-segmental dynamics into consideration. The simulated motion is visualized by graphic animation. Individual model parameters were identified by specific procedures such as anthropometric measurements, a passive pendulum test, and specific open-loop stimulation experiments. Model results were compared with experimental data obtained by stimulating the quadriceps muscle of paraplegic patients with surface electrodes. The knee moment, under isometric conditions, and the knee angle, under conditions of freely swinging shank, were measured. In view of the good correspondence obtained between model predictions and experimental data, we conclude that a biomechanical model of human motion induced by FNS can be used as a mathematical tool to support and accelerate the development of neural prostheses.},

   abstract = {In this paper we investigate the use of optimal control techniques to improve Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) for drop foot correction on hemiplegic patients. A model of the foot and the tibialis anterior muscle, the contraction of which is controlled by electrical stimulation has been established and is used in the optimal control problem. The novelty in this work is the use of the ankle accelerations and shank orientations (so-called external states) in the model, which have been measured on hemiplegic patients in a previous experiment using Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs). The optimal control problem minimizes the square of muscle excitations which serves the overall goal of reducing energy consumption in the muscle. In a first step, an offline optimal control problem is solved for test purposes and shows the efficiency of the FES optimal control for drop foot correction. In a second step, a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) problem - or online optimal control problem, is solved in a simulated environment. While the ulitmate goal is to use NMPC on the real system, i.e. directly on the patient, this test in simulation was meant to show the feasibility of NMPC for online drop foot correction. In the optimization problem, a set of fixed constraints of foot orientation was applied. Then, an original adaptive constraint taking into account the current ankle height, was introduced and tested. Comparisons between results under fixed and adaptive constraints highlight the advantage of the adaptive constraints in terms of energy consumption, where its quadratic sum of controls, obtained by NMPC, was three times lower than with the fixed constraint. This feasibility study was a first step in application of NMPC on real hemiplegic patients for online FES-based drop foot correction. The adaptive constraints method presents a new and efficient approach in terms of muscular energy consumption minimization.},

A drawback of this approach is a decreasing magnitude of flexion reflex to repeated presentations of the stimuli (habituation). Pilot data indicated that high intensity stimulation could produce dishabituation of the reflex. The aim of this study was to examine and quantify the inter- and intra- subject variability of the short and long term conditioning effect of high intensity stimulation on the magnitude of flexion reflexes in a larger number of SCI subjects. Dishabituation was observed in all subjects, however the amount of dishabituation observed was small and highly variable. However the use of high intensity conditioning stimulation may offer a means of coping with habituation in a small number of subjects.},

A robust LQR is proposed in this paper not only to stabilize the pendulum in upright position but also to make the cart system to track the given reference signal even in the presence of disturbance. The control scheme of pendulum system consists of two controllers such as swing up controller and stabilizing controller. The main focus of this work is on the design of stabilizing controller which can accommodate the disturbance present in the system in the form of wind force. An optimal LQR controller with well tuned weighting matrices is implemented to stabilize the pendulum in the vertical position. The steady state and dynamic characteristics of the proposed controller are investigated by conducting experiments on benchmark linear inverted pendulum system. Experimental results prove that the proposed LQR controller can guarantee the inverted pendulum a faster and smoother stabilizing process with less oscillation and better robustness than a Full State Feedback (FSF) controller by pole placement approach.},

The linear and nonlinear parameters are separated and estimated recursively in a parallel manner, with each updating algorithm using the most up-to-date estimation produced by the other algorithm at each time instant. Hence the procedure is termed the alternately recursive least square (ARLS) algorithm.

A discussion concerning the identification's repeatability, together with results confirming the accuracy of the overall representation, is given. The model has been used during clinical trials in which electrical stimulation is applied to the triceps muscle of a number of stroke patients for the purpose of improving both their performance at reaching tasks and their level of voluntary control over their impaired arm. Its purpose in this context is threefold: Firstly, changes occurring in the levels of stiffness and spasticity in each subject's arm can be monitored by comparing frictional components of models identified at different times during treatment. Secondly, the model is used to calculate the moments applied during tracking tasks that are due to a patient's voluntary effort, and it therefore constitutes a useful tool with which to analyze their performance. Thirdly, the model is used to derive the advanced controllers that govern the level of stimulation applied to subjects over the course of the treatment. Details are provided to show how the model is applied in each case, and sample results are shown.},

Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is a technique that is widely used for rehabilitation and restoration of motor function for people suffering from UMNL. Typically, stability analysis for closed-loop NMES ignores the modulated implementation of NMES. However, electrical stimulation must be applied to muscle as a modulated series of pulses. In this paper, a muscle activation model with an amplitude modulated control input is developed to capture the discontinuous nature of muscle activation, and an identification-based closed-loop NMES controller is designed and analyzed for the uncertain amplitude modulated muscle activation model. Semi-global uniformly ultimately bounded tracking is guaranteed. The stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed with Lyapunov-based methods, and a pulse frequency related gain condition is obtained. Experiments are performed with five able-bodied subjects to demonstrate the interplay between the control gains and the pulse frequency, and results are provided which indicate that control gains should be increased to maintain stability if the stimulation pulse frequency is decreased to mitigate muscle fatigue. For the first time, this paper brings together an analysis of the controller and modulation scheme.},

SETTING: Neuroprosthetic outpatient clinic in a university hospital.

METHODS: Five patients with spinal cord injury took part in a crossover study in which the lower limbs (1) were stimulated by functional neuromuscular electrical stimulation (FES) to induce leg cycling movements and (2) were passively moved by an ergometer machine. Patients sat in a comfortable chair fastened to the ergometer while FES was done to induce leg cycling (active session). During the passive leg movement session the ergometer moved their legs for the same period of time at the same velocity and frequency.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The change in spastic muscle tone increase before and after each training session was tested with the modified Ashworth Scale and the pendulum test of spasticity (relaxation index and peak velocity).

RESULTS: The averaged data of the relaxation index increased after FES by about 68%. Compared with the slight increase after the passive movement training of 12%, this is statistically significant (P = 0.01). Peak velocity increased after FES by around 50%, while it was nearly unchanged after the passive intervention (1%); this is also significant (P = 0.01). This was similar with the peak velocity and the modified Ashworth Scale.

CONCLUSION: The study presents further interesting aspects of the usefulness of FES in patients with spinal cord injury to reduce spastic muscle tone.},

The VCHM was compared with the isocentric reciprocating gait orthosis (IRGO) for walking after paraplegia. Both the VCHM and the IRGO were evaluated with able-bodied volunteers with the hip reciprocating mechanisms coupled and uncoupled. The VCHM was further evaluated with context-dependent coupling based on a finite-state control algorithm utilizing information from brace-mounted sensors. Walking performance for each brace condition was also compared to normal walking without an orthosis. Without the hip controller, the VCHM affected the kinematics of the hip joint in a similar manner as the IRGO, regardless of whether the hip reciprocator was coupled or uncoupled. With the controller active, hip kinematics with the VCHM were closer to normal gait than with the IRGO or any other condition tested (Intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC=0.96). The effects of the braces on the knee and ankle angles were not as prominent as their effects on the hip angles. In terms of kinetics, the VCHM with controller active allowed the generation of joint moments that were closer to normal (ICC=0.80) than the IRGO with hips coupled (ICC= 0.68). There was no statistically significant difference between the various conditions tested in terms of step-length and no statistically significant difference in the preferred walking speed between the IRGO and normal walking, whether or not the hips were coupled. However, there was a 25% reduction in walking speed with the VCHM when compared to normal, and the relative magnitudes of the EMG activity of three muscles (tibialis anterior, quadriceps, and hamstrings) were also higher with the VCHM than with either the IRGO or normal gait, likely due to the additional weight of the mechanism. Overall, the VCHM with controller active provided smooth control of the hip joints via context-dependent coupling and allowed for increased hip flexion relative to the IRGO. The results suggest that the VCHM with controlled joint coupling may eventually be a valuable component of a hybrid system combining functional electrical stimulation (FES) with orthotics.},

Yet, a fundamental barrier to NMES treatments is the rapid onset of muscle fatigue. The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of feedback-based frequency modulation on the closed-loop performance of the quadriceps during repeated dynamic contractions. METHODS: In the first experiment, subjects completed four different frequency modulation NMES protocols utilizing the same amplitude modulation control to compare the successful run times (SRTs). A second experiment was performed to determine the change in muscle response to high- and low-frequency stimulation. RESULTS: Compared with constant-frequency stimulation, results indicate that using an error-driven strategy to vary the stimulation frequency during amplitude modulation increases the number of successful contractions during non-isometric conditions. CONCLUSION: Simultaneous frequency and amplitude modulation increases the SRT during closed-loop NMES control.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this case study was to analyze the effect on gait parameters of a new design of powered gait orthosis which applied synchronized motions to both the hip and knee joints when utilized for walking by a spinal cord injury (SCI) patient. CASE DESCRIPTION AND METHODS: Two orthoses were evaluated while worn by an incomplete SCI subject. Gait evaluation was performed when walking with an isocentric reciprocating gait orthosis (IRGO) and compared to that demonstrated by a newly developed powered version. This new orthosis was based on the IRGO superstructure but incorporated powered hip and knee joints using electrically motorized actuators. FINDINGS AND OUTCOMES: These gait parameters were improved when compared to standard IRGO and initial testing with the orthosis with only the hip or the knee joints activated in isolation. Maximum hip flexion and extension angles, as well as the maximum knee flexion and extension angles all increased when walking with the powered RGO compared to the IRGO. CONCLUSIONS: Gait evaluation of this newly developed orthosis showed improvement in measured parameters when compared to walking with an IRGO. Clinical relevance This case study gave the authors confidence to extend the research to a more extensive study with a group of SCI patients.},

The controlled-brake orthosis (CBO) addresses these limitations by utilizing FES in combination with a long-leg brace that contains controllable friction brakes at the knees and hips. A laboratory version of the CBO utilizing computer-controlled magnetic particle brakes at the joints was designed and constructed, and preliminary results with a single spinal cord injury (SCI) subject have demonstrated reduced fatigue and more repeatable gait trajectories when compared to FES-aided gait without the brace. Significant work remains to demonstrate the efficacy of the concept across a wide range of SCI subjects and to design a system which meets appropriate user requirements of size, weight, cosmesis, ease of use and cost. The primary purpose of the paper is to detail the design of the CBO.},

The switched controller yields ultimately bounded tracking of a desired trajectory in the presence of an unknown, time-varying, bounded disturbance, provided a reverse dwell-time condition is satisfied by appropriate choice of the control gains and a sufficient desired cadence.

The knee extensor muscles, stimulated using surface electrodes, were used for the experimental preparation. Both healthy subjects and people with paraplegia were tested. The dynamics of the lower limb were represented by a nonlinear second order model, which took account of the gravitational and inertial characteristics of the anatomical segments as well as the damping and stiffness properties of the knee joint. The viscous-elastic parameters of the system were identified experimentally through free pendular movements of the leg. Leg movements induced by quadriceps stimulation were acquired too, using a motion analysis system. Results showed that, for the considered experimental conditions, a simple one-pole transfer function is able to model the relationship between stimulus pulsewidth (PW) and active muscle torque. The time constant of the pole was found to depend on the stimulus pattern (ramp or step) while gain was directly dependent on stimulation frequency.},

is not enough to characterize a noisy communication channel if the
channel is intended to be used as part of a feedback loop to stabilize
an unstable scalar linear system. While classical capacity is not
enough, another sense of capacity (parametrized by reliability) called
"anytime capacity" is necessary for the stabilization of an unstable
process. The required rate is given by the log of the unstable system
gain and the required reliability comes from the sense of stability
desired. A consequence of this necessity result is a sequential generalization
of the Schalkwijk-Kailath scheme for communication over the additive
white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with feedback. In cases of sufficiently
rich information patterns between the encoder and decoder, adequate
anytime capacity is also shown to be sufficient for there to exist
a stabilizing controller. These sufficiency results are then generalized
to cases with noisy observations, delayed control actions, and without
any explicit feedback between the observer and the controller. Both
necessary and sufficient conditions are extended to continuous time
systems as well. We close with comments discussing a hierarchy of
difficulty for communication problems and how these results establish
where stabilization problems sit in that hierarchy},

The proposed control architecture is a novel combination of explicit nonlinear model predictive control (EMPC) and integral sliding mode control (ISMC). Feasibility analysis of a finite-horizon optimal control problem involved in deriving the EMPC control action is performed over a polytope of interest in the state space. A sparse sampling-based boundary detection algorithm is employed to compute an approximating polynomial bounding the feasible region. A sparse-grid based interpolation scheme with Chebyshev-Gauss-Lobatto nodes and Legendre-basis polynomials are used to design the stabilizing EMPC surface. The proposed method is appealing because of the simplicity of the controller construction in conjunction with its applicability to higher-dimensional problems, which stems from the scale-ability property of sparse-grids. Robustness to the designed EMPC is provided by the ISMC. A simulated example is provided to illustrate the efficacy and performance of the proposed control strategy for the stabilization of an uncertain nonlinear dynamical system.},

The equations of motion for the vertical vehicle dynamics are presented and high-level controllers are designed using techniques from sliding mode control. Optimal control allocators are then designed by way of quadratic programs with special attention given to the differences inherent in active and semi-active (MR damper) suspension systems. Finally, the control system is implemented using a computationally efficient active set algorithm and validated in simulation with a CarSim model of a Chevrolet Equinox. Simulation shows that the control system designed here substantially improves the vertical vehicle dynamic response in the case of both active and semi-active actuators.},

The objective is to minimize the expectation of the sum of the production and ramping costs for generators while satisfying all the system constraints. The uncertainties are represented by scenarios, resulting in a large-scale and computationally demanding optimization problem. We use the optimality condition decomposition (OCD) to decompose the SMPC problem into subproblems which can be solved in parallel thereby reducing the computation time. Both a scenario-based decomposition and a temporal-based decomposition are formulated and numerically evaluated in terms of speed and convergence using a modified IEEE 39-bus test system. Simulation results indicate that the scenario-based decomposition scheme achieves a better trade-off between convergence speed and subproblem size for the considered optimal dispatch problem.},

The orthotic components consist of electromechanical joints that lock and unlock automatically to provide upright stability and free movement powered by FES. Preliminary results from a prototype device on nondisabled and SCI volunteers are presented. A novel variable coupling hip-reciprocating mechanism either acts as a standard reciprocating gait orthosis or allows each hip to independently lock or rotate freely. Rotary actuators at each hip are configured in a closed hydraulic circuit and regulated by a finite state postural controller based on real-time sensor information. The knee mechanism locks during stance to prevent collapse and unlocks during swing, while the ankle is constrained to move in the sagittal plane under FES-only control. The trunk is fixed in a rigid corset, and new ankle and trunk mechanisms are under development. Because the exoskeletal control mechanisms were built from off-the-shelf components, weight and cosmesis specifications for clinical use have not been met, although the power requirements are low enough to provide more than 4 hours of continuous operation with standard camcorder batteries.},

This model is the simplest special case of the passive-dynamic models pioneered by McGeer (1990a). It has two rigid massless legs hinged at the hip, a point-mass at the hip, and infinitesimal point-masses at the feet. The feet have plastic (no-slip, no-bounce) collisions with the slope surface, except during forward swinging, when geometric interference (foot scuffing) is ignored. After nondimensionalizing the governing equations, the model has only one free parameter, the ramp slope gamma. This model shows stable walking modes similar to more elaborate models, but allows some use of analytic methods to study its dynamics. The analytic calculations find initial conditions and stability estimates for period-one gait limit cycles. The model exhibits two period-one gait cycles, one of which is stable when 0 < gamma < 0.015 rad. With increasing gamma, stable cycles of higher periods appear, and the walking-like motions apparently become chaotic through a sequence of period doublings. Scaling laws for the model predict that walking speed is proportional to stance angle, stance angle is proportional to gamma 1/3, and that the gravitational power used is proportional to v4 where v is the velocity along the slope.},

Given the limitations of FNS, specifically low muscle strengths, high rates of fatigue, and a limited ability to modulate muscle excitations, it remains unclear, however, whether FNS can be developed as a practical means to control the lower extremity musculature to restore aesthetic, unsupported gait to paraplegics. A computer simulation of FNS-assisted bipedal gait shows that it is difficult, but possible to attain undisturbed, level gait at normal speeds provided the electrically-stimulated ankle plantarflexors exhibit either near-normal strengths or are augmented by an orthosis, and at least seven muscle-groups in each leg are stimulated. A combination of dynamic programming and an open-loop, trial-and-error adjustment process was used to find a suboptimal set of discretely-varying muscle stimulation patterns needed for a 3-D, 8 degree-of-freedom dynamic model to sustain a step. An ankle-foot orthosis was found to be especially useful, as it helped to stabilize the stance leg and simplified the task of controlling the foot during swing. It is believed that the process of simulating natural gait with this model will serve to highlight difficulties to be expected during laboratory and clinical trials.},

   abstract = {The moment arm of the knee-extensor mechanism is described by the moment arm of the patellar tendon calculated with respect to the screw axis of the tibia relative to the femur. The moment arm may be found once the line of action of the patellar tendon and the position and orientation of the screw axis are known. In this study, the orientation of the patellar tendon and the position and orientation of the finite screw axis of the tibia relative to the femur were calculated from measurements of the three-dimensional positions of the bones obtained from fresh cadaver specimens. Peak values of the patellar tendon moment arm ranged from 4-6 cm for the six knees tested; the moment arm was maximum near 45 degrees of knee flexion. The moment arm of the patellar tendon was nearly equal to the shortest (perpendicular) distance between the line of action of the patellar tendon and the axis of rotation of the knee at all flexion angles, except near full extension. Near full extension, the angle between the patellar tendon and the screw axis was significantly less than 90 degrees, and the magnitude of the moment arm was then less than the perpendicular distance between these two lines. The patellar tendon moment arm remained roughly constant across individuals when normalized by femoral condyle width, suggesting that anatomical differences play a large role in determining the moment arm of the extensor mechanism.},

Such a solution, inspired by the classical bang-bang optimal control strategy, is first depicted and expressed in terms of a control algorithm by introducing a suitable auxiliary problem involving a second-order uncertain system with unavailable velocity. Then, the applicability of the algorithm is extended, via suitable modifications, to the case of nonlinear systems with uncertainties of more general types. The proposed algorithm does not require the use of observers and differential inequalities and can be applied in practice by exploiting such commercial components as peak detectors or other approximated methods to evaluate the change of the sign of the derivative of the quantity accounting for the distance to the sliding manifold},

The data from four dual-axis accelerometers and four FSRs were inputs, while six muscle activation profiles were outputs. The controller includes two stages: 1) estimating the target gait pattern using artificial neural networks; and 2) optimal control minimizing tracking errors (from the estimated gait pattern) and muscle efforts. The controller was tested using data collected from six healthy subjects walking at five speeds (0.6-1.4 m/s). The average root mean square errors (RMSEs) normalized by the peak-to-peak value of the target signals [normalized RMSE (NRMSE)] were below 6%, 7%, 8%, and 3% for estimation of joint angles, hip acceleration, ground reaction force, and movement of the center of pressure, respectively. Using the estimated data as inputs, the simulation generated the target healthy-like gait patterns and reproducible muscle activation profiles in 90% of 300 tested gait trials. Overall tracking NRMSE was between 2% and 9%. The optimal controller was developed for testing the feasibility of healthy-like gait patterns in hemiplegic individuals, and generating a knowledge base that is required for the synthesis of a sensory-driven control of walking assisted by functional electrical stimulation.},

   abstract = {During functional electrical stimulation (FES), both the frequency
and intensity can be increased to increase muscle force output and
counteract the effects of muscle fatigue. Most current FES systems,
however, deliver a constant frequency and only vary the stimulation
intensity to control muscle force. This study compared muscle performance
and fatigue produced during repetitive electrical stimulation using
three different strategies: (1) constant pulse-duration and stepwise
increases in frequency (frequency-modulation); (2) constant frequency
and stepwise increases in pulse-duration (pulse-duration-modulation);
and (3) constant frequency and pulse-duration (no-modulation). Surface
electrical stimulation was delivered to the quadriceps femoris muscles
of 12 healthy individuals and isometric forces were recorded. Muscle
performance was assessed by measuring the percent changes in the
peak forces and force-time integrals between the first and the last
fatiguing trains. Muscle fatigue was assessed by measuring percent
declines in peak force between the 60Hz pre- and post-fatigue testing
trains. The results showed that frequency-modulation showed better
performance for both peak forces and force-time integrals in response
to the fatiguing trains than pulse-duration-modulation, while producing
similar levels of muscle fatigue. Although frequency-modulation is
not commonly used during FES, clinicians should consider this strategy
to improve muscle performance.},

We present the simulation for generating offline input (sensors)-output (intensity of muscle stimulation) representation of walking that serves in synthesizing a rule-base for control of electrical stimulation for restoration of walking. The simulation uses new algorithm termed moving-window dynamic optimization (MWDO). The optimization criterion was to minimize the sum of the squares of tracking errors from desired trajectories with the penalty function on the total muscle efforts. The MWDO was developed in the MATLAB environment and tested using target trajectories characteristic for slow-to-normal walking recorded in healthy individual and a model with the parameters characterizing the potential hemiplegic user. The outputs of the simulation are piecewise constant intensities of electrical stimulation and trajectories generated when the calculated stimulation is applied to the model. We demonstrated the importance of this simulation by showing the outputs for healthy and hemiplegic individuals, using the same target trajectories. Results of the simulation show that the MWDO is an efficient tool for analyzing achievable trajectories and for determining the stimulation profiles that need to be delivered for good tracking.},

   abstract = {Although people's legs are capable of a broad range of muscle-use and gait patterns, they generally prefer just two. They walk, swinging their body over a relatively straight leg with each step, or run, bouncing up off a bent leg between aerial phases. Walking feels easiest when going slowly, and running feels easiest when going faster. More unusual gaits seem more tiring. Perhaps this is because walking and running use the least energy. Addressing this classic conjecture with experiments requires comparing walking and running with many other strange and unpractised gaits. As an alternative, a basic understanding of gait choice might be obtained by calculating energy cost by using mechanics-based models. Here we use a minimal model that can describe walking and running as well as an infinite variety of other gaits. We use computer optimization to find which gaits are indeed energetically optimal for this model. At low speeds the optimization discovers the classic inverted-pendulum walk, at high speeds it discovers a bouncing run, even without springs, and at intermediate speeds it finds a new pendular-running gait that includes walking and running as extreme cases.},

@article{Bertram2005,
   abstract = {As walking speed increases, consistent relationships emerge between the three determinant parameters of walking, speed, step frequency and step length. However, when step length or step frequency are predetermined rather than speed, different relationships are spontaneously selected. This result is expected if walking parameters are selected to optimize to an underlying objective function, known as the constrained optimization hypothesis. The most likely candidate for the objective function is metabolic cost per distance traveled, where the hypothesis predicts that the subject will minimize the cost of travel under a given gait constraint even if this requires an unusual step length and frequency combination. In the current study this is tested directly by measuring the walking behavior of subjects constrained systematically to determined speeds, step frequencies or step lengths and comparing behavior to predictions derived directly from minimization of measured metabolic cost. A metabolic cost surface in speed-frequency space is derived from metabolic rate for 10 subjects walking at 49 speed-frequency conditions. Optimization is predicted from the iso-energetic cost contours derived from this surface. Substantial congruence is found between the predicted and observed behavior using the cost of walking per unit distance. Although minimization of cost per distance appears to dominate walking control, certain notable differences from predicted behavior suggest that other factors must also be considered. The results of these studies provide a new perspective on the integration of walking cost with neuromuscular control, and provide a novel approach to the investigation of the control features involved in gait parameter selection.},

   abstract = {This study introduces a Functional Electrical Therapy (FET) system based on sensor-driven electrical stimulation for the augmentation of walking. The automatic control relates to the timing of stimulation of four muscles. The sensor system comprises accelerometers and force-sensing resistors. The automatic control implements IF-THEN rules designed by mapping of sensors and muscle activation patterns. The new system was tested in 13 acute stroke patients assigned to a FET group or a control (CON) group. Both groups were treated with a standard rehabilitation program and 45min of walking daily for 5 days over the course of 4 weeks. The FET group received electrical stimulation during walking. The Fugl-Meyer (FM) test for the lower extremities, Barthel Index (BI), mean walking velocity (v(mean)) over a 6-m distance, and Physiological Cost Index (PCI) were assessed at the entry point and at the end of the treatment. Subjects within the FET and CON groups had comparable baseline outcome measures. In the FET group, we determined significant differences in the mean values of all outcomes between the entry and end points of treatment (p<0.05), contrary to the CON group where we found no significant differences (p>0.05). We also found significant differences in the changes of FM, BI, v(mean) and PCI which occurred during the 4 weeks of treatment between the FET and CON groups (p<0.05). The statistical strength of the clinical study was low (<70%), suggesting the need for a larger, randomized clinical trial.},

   abstract = {Applications of electrical stimulation for restoration of functional
movements such as standing, gait, and grasp have always been hindered
by the rapid fatigue of stimulated muscle. This paper describes an
experimental investigation of stimulation with N-lets (a set of N
closely spaced stimulation pulses) as a means of producing contractions
with improved fatigue characteristics. Experiments were conducted
on 27 able-bodied and four SCI human subjects using surface stimulation
of the quadriceps muscle to produce isometric knee joint torque.
Based upon evidence from the literature on muscle fatigue, parameters
of the N-let trains for N = 1-6 were optimized to produce the most
force per pulse. The results demonstrated that: 1) nonlinear summation
of the twitch response occurs in human subjects with N-let surface
stimulation; 2) for most subjects, doublet stimulation (N = 2) with
a pulse interval of about 5 ms produced the maximum torque-time integral
per pulse of the resulting twitch; and 3) on average, optimal N-let
stimulation resulted in a 36% increase in isometric torque tracking
when compared to traditional singlet stimulation. The results have
immediate implications for alleviating the problem of premature fatigue
during functional electrical stimulation.},

That is, the algorithm learns online in real-time the solution to the optimal control design HJ equation. This method finds in real-time suitable approximations of both the optimal cost and the optimal control policy, while also guaranteeing closed-loop stability. We present an online adaptive algorithm implemented as an actor/critic structure which involves simultaneous continuous-time adaptation of both actor and critic neural networks. We call this ‘synchronous’ policy iteration. A persistence of excitation condition is shown to guarantee convergence of the critic to the actual optimal value function. Novel tuning algorithms are given for both critic and actor networks, with extra nonstandard terms in the actor tuning law being required to guarantee closed-loop dynamical stability. The convergence to the optimal controller is proven, and the stability of the system is also guaranteed. Simulation examples show the effectiveness of the new algorithm.},

   abstract = {The purpose of this paper was to determine the effects of stimulation
pattern and frequency on repetitive human knee movements. Quadriceps
femoris muscles were stimulated against a load equal to 10% of each
subject's maximum voluntary isometric force. The main variable of
interest was the number of repetitions in which the leg reached a
target angle of 40 degrees of knee extension. Sixteen different trains
were tested, including 1) six constant-frequency trains with frequencies
ranging from 9 to 100 Hz, 2) five variable-frequency trains with
an initial 5-ms triplet and mean frequencies ranging from 11 to 35
Hz, and 3) five doublet-frequency trains, which used doublets (2
pulses with a 5-ms interpulse interval) to replace single pulses,
with mean frequencies of 17-57 Hz. Testing was stopped when the subject
failed to reach the target angle for three consecutive activations.
Results showed that no single pattern was best for all subjects.
The 33- and 100-Hz constant-frequency trains, 35-Hz variable-frequency
trains, and 27- and 36-Hz doublet frequency trains each met the target
the most times for some subjects. The results showed that, under
our testing conditions, higher frequency trains were better suited
for producing repetitive knee movements than lower frequency trains.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess the change in bone mineral density (BMD) after spinal cord injury (SCI) and to evaluate whether BMD loss can be reversed with the intervention of functional electric stimulation cycling exercises (FESCE). METHODS: Fifteen males with SCI were included. Fifteen able-bodied males were also tested to compare BMD. In the SCI group, the FESCE was performed for six months, and then was discontinued in the subsequent six months. BMD was performed before the FESCE, immediately after six months of the FESCE, and at the end of the subsequent six months. RESULTS: Before the FESCE, the BMD of the SCI subjects in every site, except the lumbar spine, was lower than that of the able-bodied subjects. After six months of FESCE, BMD of the distal femur (DF) and proximal tibia (PT) increased significantly, and BMD of the calcaneus (heel) showed a trend of increase. However, the BMD in the DF, PT, and heel decreased significantly after the subsequent six months without FESCE. The BMD of the femoral neck (FN) decreased progressively throughout the programme. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed site-specific BMD changes after FESCE. The BMD loss in the DF and PT was partially reversed after six months of FESCE, but the effect faded once the exercise was discontinued.},

   abstract = {Muscles coordinate multijoint motion by generating forces that cause reaction forces throughout the body. Thus, a muscle can redistribute existing segmental energy by accelerating some segments and decelerating others. In the process, a muscle may also produce or absorb energy, in which case its summed energetic effect on the segments is positive or negative, respectively. This Borelli Lecture shows how dynamical simulations derived from musculoskeletal models reveal muscle-induced segmental energy redistribution and muscle co-functions and synergies. Synergy occurs when co-excited muscles distribute segmental energy differently to execute the motor task. In maximum height jumping, high vertical velocity at lift-off occurs desirably at full body extension because biarticular leg muscles redistribute the energy produced by the uniarticular leg muscles. In pedaling, synergistic ankle plantarflexor force generation during leg extension allows the high energy produced by the uniarticular hip and knee extensors to be delivered to the crank. An analogous less-powerful flexor synergy exists during leg flexion. Hamstrings reduce crank deceleration during the leg extension-to-flexion transition by not only producing energy but delivering it to the crank through its contribution to the tangential (accelerating) crank force, though this hamstrings function occurs at the opposite (flexion-extension) transition when pedaling backwards. In walking, the eccentric quadriceps activity in early stance not only decelerates the leg but also accelerates the trunk. In mid-stance, the uni- and biarticular plantarflexors, by having opposite segmental energetic effects, act in synergy to support the whole body, so segmental potential and kinetic energy exchange can occur. To conclude, the extraction of unmeasurable variables from dynamical simulations emulating task kinematics, kinetics, and EMGs shows how the production of force and energy by individual muscles contribute to the energy flow among the individual segments during task execution.},

   abstract = {This review describes how computational modeling can be combined with noninvasive gait measurements to describe and explain muscle and joint function in human locomotion. Five muscles--the gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, vasti, soleus, and gastrocnemius--contribute most significantly to the accelerations of the center of mass in the vertical, fore-aft, and medio-lateral directions when humans walk and run at their preferred speeds. Humans choose to switch from a walk to a run at speeds near 2 m s(-1) to enhance the biomechanical performance of the ankle plantarflexors and to improve coordination of the knee and ankle muscles during stance. Muscles that do not span a joint can contribute to the contact force transmitted by that joint and therefore affect its stability. In walking, for example, uniarticular muscles that cross the hip and ankle act to create the adduction moment at the knee, thereby contributing to the contact force present in the medial compartment.},

   abstract = {Model predictive control is a form of control in which the current control action is obtained by solving, at each sampling instant, a finite horizon open-loop optimal control problem, using the current state of the plant as the initial state; the optimization yields an optimal control sequence and the first control in this sequence is applied to the plant. An important advantage of this type of control is its ability to cope with hard constraints on controls and states. It has, therefore, been widely applied in petro-chemical and related industries where satisfaction of constraints is particularly important because efficiency demands operating points on or close to the boundary of the set of admissible states and controls. In this review, we focus on model predictive control of constrained systems, both linear and nonlinear and discuss only briefly model predictive control of unconstrained nonlinear and/or time-varying systems. We concentrate our attention on research dealing with stability and optimality; in these areas the subject has developed, in our opinion, to a stage where it has achieved sufficient maturity to warrant the active interest of researchers in nonlinear control. We distill from an extensive literature essential principles that ensure stability and use these to present a concise characterization of most of the model predictive controllers that have been proposed in the literature. In some cases the finite horizon optimal control problem solved on-line is exactly equivalent to the same problem with an infinite horizon; in other cases it is equivalent to a modified infinite horizon optimal control problem. In both situations, known advantages of infinite horizon optimal control accrue.},

   abstract = {A crucial issue of functional electrical stimulation (FES) is the control of motor function by the artificial activation of paralyzed muscles. Major problems that limit the success of current FES systems are the nonlinearity of the target system and the rapid change of muscle properties due to fatigue. In this study, four different strategies, including an adaptive algorithm, to control the movement of the freely swinging shank were developed on the basis of computer simulations and experimentally evaluated on two subjects with paraplegia due to a complete thoracic spinal cord injury. After developing a nonlinear, physiologically based model describing the dynamic behavior of the knee joint and muscles, an open-loop approach, a closed-loop approach, and a combination of both were tested. In order to automate the individual adjustments cited above, we further evaluated the performances of an adaptive feedforward controller. The two parameters chosen for the adaptation were the threshold pulse width and the scaling factor for adjusting the active moment produced by the stimulated muscle to the fitness of the muscle. These parameters have been chosen because of their significant time variability. The first three controllers with fixed parameters yielded satisfactory result. An additional improvement was achieved by applying the adaptive algorithm that could cope with problems due to muscle fatigue, thus permitting on-line identification of critical parameters of the plant. Although the present study is limited to a simplified experimental setup, its applicability to more complex and functional movements can be expected.},

The data used to test the model were produced by stimulation trains with resting times of 500 ms. Because the resting times between stimulation trains affect muscle fatigue, this study tested the model's ability to predict the effect of resting times on fatigue. In addition, because this study included different subjects than those used to develop the model, the validity of the model could be tested. Data were collected from human quadriceps femoris muscles using fatigue protocols that included resting times of 500, 750, or 1000 ms. Our results showed that the model predicted fatigue as being a decreasing function of resting time, which was consistent with experimental data. Reliability tests between the experimental data and predictions showed interclass correlation coefficients of 0.97, 0.95, and 0.81 for the initial, final, and percentage decline in peak forces, respectively, suggesting strong agreement between the experimental data and the predictions by the model. The success of our current force- and fatigue-model system helps to validate the model and suggests its potential use in identifying the optimal activation pattern during clinical application of functional electrical stimulation.},

This paper presents modifications to our previously developed force- and fatigue-model system to improve the accuracy in predicting forces during repetitive activation of human skeletal muscle. By comparing the predictions produced by the modified force and fatigue models to those by our previous models, the modification appears to be successful. The current force- and fatigue-model system accounts for about 93% variance in experimental data produced by fatigue protocols consisting of trains with a wide range of frequencies and pulse patterns. In addition, the present models successfully predict the effect of stimulation frequency and pulse pattern on muscle fatigue. The success of our current force- and fatigue-model system suggests its potential use in helping to identify the optimal activation pattern to use during the clinical application of functional electrical stimulation.},

The current study investigated the model's ability to predict force responses to longer stimulation trains under both nonfatigued and fatigued conditions. Using the six-pulse train model to predict the force produced by longer stimulation trains showed that the model was successful, but a modified parameter identification scheme was required. For most of the trains tested the model accounted for 95% of the variance in the experimental forces produced by stimulation trains, with mean frequencies from 12.5 to 100 HZ, train durations from 485 to 1000 ms, and number of pulses from 14 to 50 for both nonfatigued and fatigued muscles. The success of our mathematical model in predicting forces produced by stimulations with a wide range of frequencies, durations, and number of pulses implies great potential of the model for the identification of optimal activation patterns that should be used during functional electrical stimulation.},

   abstract = {In a previous work, we studied the mechanical and the metabolic profiles of fatigue of paralyzed quadriceps muscle under activation by FES. The metabolic state of the muscle during stimulation of paraplegic patients was monitored, simultaneously with the decaying force, by using 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In the present work, a musculotendon model was developed to enable prediction of the force output during continuous electrical stimulation. The model consisted of five elements, including the tendon, the parallel elastic, contractile and damper muscle elements, as well as the muscle mass. The mechanism of the contractile element was based upon the length-tension and the velocity-tension curves, the activation trajectory, and the experimentally obtained relationship between force and intracellular pH. In the equations obtained, three sets of parameters were used: 1) general muscle parameters, associated with the length-tension curves of tendon, fascia, and muscle and the velocity-tension curve of the contractile element; 2) specific anthropometric parameters of the muscle; and 3) fatigue parameters which were obtained from our previously recorded experimental data. The model was formulated to allow prediction of the quadriceps muscle force under dynamic activation and at various levels of stimulation. The model solution was for isometric contraction in supermaximal stimulation, and it provided the force decaying profiles, which were compared to those obtained experimentally. The parameters yielding the best fit between the model and the experimental results were indicated. Particularly, two muscle nonspecific parameters, namely, the muscle stress parameter and the parameter representing the ratio between the muscle's slack length and its length in vivo at various knee angles, were determined using the model. The muscle stress parameter was found to be between 60 and 64 N/cm2, and the length ratio was 0.952, 0.935, 0.920, and 0.901 for the 0, 30, 60, and 90 degrees knee angle, respectively. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was conducted of the model to perturbations of these two estimated parameters, revealing that the model was sensitive to these parameters.},

Human walking was synthesized by numerical integration of the coupled muscle-tendon and rigid body dynamics. To this end a control algorithm based on the lambda-model was implemented in the model providing muscle stimulation patterns that guaranteed dynamically stable walking including a balanced trunk. Thus, the timing of the movement is not preset by a central pattern generator but emerges from the interaction of the musculoskeletal system with the control algorithm. The control parameters were found in a trial-and-error approach. The feedforward part of the control scheme consists of just two target configurations each of which is composed of a set of one nominal length per muscle (lambda-model). Variation of gravity reveals that (1) the synthesized walking patterns are close to ballistic walking and (2) this muscularly induced natural walking can only be initiated and maintained in the range between about a tenth and three times earth-bound gravity. Our walking patterns are robust both against parameter variations and shuffling of the swing leg. We discuss our model with respect to gravity scaling, speed control, feedback delay, and the terms "equilibrium point hypothesis" and "central pattern generator."},

   abstract = {Individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) often experience bone loss and muscle atrophy. Muscle atrophy can result in reduced metabolic rate and increase the risk of metabolic disorders. Sublesional osteoporosis predisposes individuals with SCI to an increased risk of low-trauma fracture. Fractures in people with SCI have been reported during transfers from bed to chair, and while being turned in bed. The bone loss and muscle atrophy that occur after SCI are substantial and may be influenced by factors such as completeness of injury or time postinjury. A number of interventions, including standing, electrically stimulated cycling or resistance training, and walking exercises have been explored with the aim of reducing bone loss and/or increasing bone mass and muscle mass in individuals with SCI. Exercise with electrical stimulation appears to increase muscle mass and/or prevent atrophy, but studies investigating its effect on bone are conflicting. Several methodological limitations in exercise studies with individuals with SCI to date limit our ability to confirm the utility of exercise for improving skeletal status. The impact of standing or walking exercises on muscle and bone has not been well established. Future research should carefully consider the study design, skeletal measurement sites, and the measurement techniques used in order to facilitate sound conclusions.},

@article{Sharma2017,
   abstract = {Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is a promising technique to artificially activate muscles as a means to potentially restore the capability to perform functional tasks in persons with neurological disorders. A pervasive problem with NMES is that overstimulation of the muscle (among other factors) leads to rapid muscle fatigue, which limits the use of clinical and commercial NMES systems. The objective of this paper is to develop an NMES controller that incorporates the effects of muscle fatigue during NMES-induced non-isometric contraction of the human quadriceps femoris muscle. Our previous work that used the RISE class of nonlinear controllers cannot accommodate fatigue and muscle activation dynamics. A totally new control design approach and associated stability proof is required to derive a new class of NMES control design that accounts for muscle fatigue dynamics and a first order activation dynamics, in addition to the second order musculoskeletal dynamics. Motivated from a control method for robotic systems in a strict-feedback form, a backstepping based nonlinear NMES controller was designed to accommodate for the additional muscle activation dynamics. Further, experimentally identified estimates of the fatigue and activation dynamics were incorporated in the control design. The developed controller uses a neural network-based estimate of the musculoskeletal dynamics and error due to fatigue estimation. A globally uniformly ultimately bounded stability is proven the new controller that accounts for an uncertain nonlinear muscle model and bounded nonlinear disturbances (e.g., spasticity, changing load dynamics). The developed controller was validated through experiments on the left and right legs of 3 able-bodied subjects and was compared with a proportional-derivative (PD) controller and a PD augmented with a neural network. The statistical analysis showed improved control performance compared to the PD controller.},

   abstract = {This book is open access under a CC BY 4.0 license. This book bridges the gap between playing with robots in school and studying robotics at the upper undergraduate and graduate levels to prepare for careers in industry and research. Robotic algorithms are presented formally, but using only mathematics known by high-school and first-year college students, such as calculus, matrices and probability. Concepts and algorithms are explained through detailed diagrams and calculations. Elements of Robotics presents an overview of different types of robots and the components used to build robots, but focuses on robotic algorithms: simple algorithms like odometry and feedback control, as well as algorithms for advanced topics like localization, mapping, image processing, machine learning and swarm robotics. These algorithms are demonstrated in simplified contexts that enable detailed computations to be performed and feasible activities to be posed. Students who study these simplified demonstrations will be well prepared for advanced study of robotics. The algorithms are presented at a relatively abstract level, not tied to any specific robot. Instead a generic robot is defined that uses elements common to most educational robots: differential drive with two motors, proximity sensors and some method of displaying output to the use. The theory is supplemented with over 100 activities, most of which can be successfully implemented using inexpensive educational robots. Activities that require more computation can be programmed on a computer. Archives are available with suggested implementations for the Thymio robot and standalone programs in Python.},

@book{Goodfellow2016,
   abstract = {Deep learning is a form of machine learning that enables computers to learn from experience and understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts. Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models. Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms. A website offers supplementary material for both readers and instructors.},

Sources of uncertainty include equally plausible alternative explanations, missing information, incorrect object and event typing, diffuse evidence, ambiguous references, prediction of future events, and deliberate deception. We provide a brief overview of the history of uncertainty management in AI systems, including perceptrons, first order predicate logics, Bayesian networks, neural networks, fuzzy logic, and the Dempster-Shafer theory. The flavor of the research and corresponding technological capabilities in automated inductive reasoning is illustrated. A limited instance of everyday human cognition is represented using a hybrid symbolic and probabilistic representation along with powerful automated inference solution algorithms. It is concluded that uncertainty management-driven advances in automated inductive reasoning raise the hope that AI systems might soon accelerate our rate of scientific discovery.},

   abstract = {Unlike other image formats, SVG can be an interactive part of your web site, integrated in HTML5 markup or created dynamically using JavaScript. It can be styled by CSS to instantly adapt to changes in your site's design. Flexible metadata options can make the graphics accessible to screen readers and search engines. And it is always displayed at the highest resolution possible, without requiring larger file sizes, making it ideal for both widescreen desktop displays and Retina mobile devices. Using SVG with CSS3 and HTML5 starts with the basics, explaining how simple shapes and icons are defined in SVG, and then builds upon that foundation to create complex graphics and interactive, animated applications. It covers all the features you're likely to come across in web design, while avoiding areas with poor browser support.},

It is shown that the two formulations are mathematically equivalent providing a check on their consistency.

   abstract = {A dynamical extension that makes possible the integration of a kinematic controller and a torque controller for nonholonomic mobile robots is presented. A combined kinematic/torque control law is developed using backstepping, and asymptotic stability is guaranteed by Lyapunov theory. Moreover, this control algorithm can be applied to the three basic nonholonomic navigation problems: tracking a reference trajectory, path following, and stabilization about a desired posture. The result is a general structure for controlling a mobile robot that can accommodate different control techniques, ranging from a conventional computed-torque controller, when all dynamics are known, to robust-adaptive controllers if this is not the case. A robust-adaptive controller based on neural networks (NNs) is proposed in this work. The NN controller can deal with unmodeled bounded disturbances and/or unstructured unmodeled dynamics in the vehicle. On-line NN weight tuning algorithms that do not require off-line learning yet guarantee small tracking errors and bounded control signals are utilized.},

@article{Zhang2014,
   abstract = {We propose a real-time method for odometry and mapping using range measurements from a 2-axis lidar moving in 6-DOF. The problem is hard because the range measurements are received at different times, and errors in motion estimation can cause mis-registration of the resulting point cloud. To date, coherent 3D maps can be built by off-line batch methods, often using loop closure to correct for drift over time. Our method achieves both low-drift and low-computational complexity with- out the need for high accuracy ranging or inertial measurements. The key idea in obtaining this level of performance is the division of the complex problem of simultaneous localization and mapping, which seeks to optimize a large number of variables simultaneously, by two algorithms. One algorithm performs odometry at a high frequency but low fidelity to estimate velocity of the lidar. Another algorithm runs at a frequency of an order of magnitude lower for fine matching and registration of the point cloud. Combination of the two algorithms allows the method to map in real-time. The method has been evaluated by a large set of experiments as well as on the KITTI odometry benchmark. The results indicate that the method can achieve accuracy at the level of state of the art offline batch methods.},

Through analysis of the achievable educational goals based on the technological status and specific learning modes of different types of robots, it is possible to define three pedagogical paradigms: learning robotics, learning with robotics, and learning by robotics. In this book we address these three paradigms through three themes: human representations of robots, the acceptance and trust shown when interacting with a humanoid, and learning favored by the development and programming of robots in an educational context. These themes allow the authors to fully explore, define and delimit this novel field of research for future application in educational and social contexts. Finally, the book discusses contributions and limitations which have emerged from different methodologies of research, potential educational applications, and concepts of human-robot interaction for the development of the above paradigms. © ISTE Ltd 2016.},

   abstract = {To navigate reliably in indoorenvironments, amobile robot must know where it is. Thus, reliable position estimation is a key problem in mobile robotics. We believe that prob- abilistic approaches are among the most promising can- didates to providing a comprehensive and real-time solu- tion to the robot localization problem. However, current methods still face considerable hurdles. In particular, the problems encountered are closely related to the type of representation used to represent probability densities over the robot’s state space. Recent work on Bayesian filter- ing with particle-based density representations opens up a new approach formobile robot localization, based on these principles. In this paper we introduce the Monte Carlo Localization method, where we represent the probability density involved by maintaining a set of samples that are randomly drawn fromit. By using a sampling-based repre- sentation we obtain a localization method that can repre- sent arbitrary distributions. We show experimentally that the resulting method is able to efficiently localize a mo- bile robot without knowledge of its starting location. It is faster, more accurate and less memory-intensive than ear- lier grid-based methods. 1},

In this practical guide, author Matthew Kirk takes you through the principles of TDD and machine learning, and shows you how to apply TDD to several machine-learning algorithms, including Naive Bayesian classifiers and Neural Networks. Machine-learning algorithms often have tests baked in, but they can’t account for human errors in coding. Rather than blindly rely on machine-learning results as many researchers have, you can mitigate the risk of errors with TDD and write clean, stable machine-learning code. If you’re familiar with Ruby 2.1, you’re ready to start. • Apply TDD to write and run tests before you start coding • Learn the best uses and tradeoffs of eight machine learning algorithms • Use real-world examples to test each algorithm through engaging, hands-on exercises • Understand the similarities between TDD and the scientific method for validating solutions • Be aware of the risks of machine learning, such as underfitting and overfitting data • Explore techniques for improving your machine-learning models or data extraction},

MCL is a version of Markov localization, a family of probabilis- tic approaches that have recently been applied with great practical success. However, previous approaches were ei- ther computationally cumbersome (such as grid-based ap- proaches that represent the state space by high-resolution 3D grids), or had to resort to extremely coarse-grained res- olutions. Our approach is computationally efficient while retaining the ability to represent (almost) arbitrary distri- butions. MCL applies sampling-based methods for approx- imating probability distributions, in a way that places com- putation“where needed.” The number of samples is adapted on-line, thereby invoking large sample sets only when neces- sary. Empirical results illustrate that MCL yields improved accuracy while requiring an order of magnitude less com- putation when compared to previous approaches. It is also much easier to implement.},

   abstract = {Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and Visual SLAM (V-SLAM) in particular have been an active area of research lately. In V-SLAM the main focus is most often laid on the localization part of the problem allowing for a drift free motion estimate. To this end, a sparse set of landmarks is tracked and their position is estimated. However, this set of landmarks (rendering the map) is often too sparse for tasks in autonomous driving such as navigation, path planning, obstacle avoidance etc. Some methods keep the raw measurements for past robot poses to address the sparsity problem often resulting in a pose only SLAM akin to laser scanner SLAM. For the stereo case, this is however impractical due to the high noise of stereo reconstructed point clouds. In this paper we propose a dense stereo V-SLAM algorithm that estimates a dense 3D map representation which is more accurate than raw stereo measurements. Thereto, we run a sparse V-SLAM system, take the resulting pose estimates to compute a locally dense representation from dense stereo correspondences. This dense representation is expressed in local coordinate systems which are tracked as part of the SLAM estimate. This allows the dense part to be continuously updated. Our system is driven by visual odometry priors to achieve high robustness when tracking landmarks. Moreover, the sparse part of the SLAM system uses recently published sub mapping techniques to achieve constant runtime complexity most of the time. The improved accuracy over raw stereo measurements is shown in a Monte Carlo simulation. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of our method by presenting outdoor experiments of a car like robot.},

The Gamma-SLAM algorithm uses a Rao–Blackwellized particle filter to obtain a joint posterior over poses andmaps: the pose distribution is estimated using a particle filter, and each particle has its own map that is obtained through exact filtering conditioned on the particle’s pose. Visual odometry is used to provide good proposal distributions for the particle filter, andmaps are represented using a Cartesian grid. Unlike previous gridbased SLAM algorithms, however, the Gamma-SLAM map maintains a posterior distribution over the \textit\{elevation variance \}in each cell. This variance grid map can capture rocks, vegetation, and other objects that are typically found in unstructured environments but are not well modeled by traditional occupancy or elevation grid maps. The algorithm runs in real time on conventional processors and has been evaluated for both qualitative and quantitative accuracy in three outdoor environments over trajectories totaling 1,600 m in length.},

The new SLAM formulation is derived from the nonlinear least squares (NLS) formulation by mathematically formulating loop-closure cycles as constraints. Under the constrained SLAM formulation, we study the robustness of an incremental SLAM algorithm against local minima and outliers as a constraint/loop-closure cycle selection problem. We find a constraint metric that can predict the objec-tive function growth after including the constraint. By the virtue of the constraint metric, we select constraints into the incremental SLAM according to a least objective function growth principle to increase robustness against local minima and perform χ 2 differ-ence test on the constraint metric to increase robustness against outliers. Finally, using sequential quadratic programming (SQP) as the solver, an incremental SLAM algorithm (iSQP) is proposed. Experimental validations are provided to illustrate the accuracy of the constraint metric and the robustness of the proposed incre-mental SLAM algorithm. Nonetheless, the proposed approach is currently confined to datasets with sparse loop-closures due to its computational cost.

This methodology has been adopted in various fields, including finance, geophysical systems, wireless communications, control, navigation and tracking, and robotics [2].

To address this issue, we present Motion Planning Networks (MPNet), a neural network-based novel planning algorithm. The proposed method encodes the given workspaces directly from a point cloud measurement and generates the end-to-end collision-free paths for the given start and goal configurations. We evaluate MPNet on various 2D and 3D environments including the planning of a 7 DOF Baxter robot manipulator. The results show that MPNet is not only consistently computationally efficient in all environments but also generalizes to completely unseen environments. The results also show that the computation time of MPNet consistently remains less than 1 second in all presented experiments, which is significantly lower than existing state-of-the-art motion planning algorithms.},

Self-driving vehicles (SDVs) are expected to prevent road accidents and save millions of lives while improving the livelihood and life quality of many more. However, despite large interest and a number of industry players working in the autonomous domain, there still remains more to be done in order to develop a system capable of operating at a level comparable to best human drivers. One reason for this is high uncertainty of traffic behavior and large number of situations that an SDV may encounter on the roads, making it very difficult to create a fully generalizable system. To ensure safe and efficient operations, an autonomous vehicle is required to account for this uncertainty and to anticipate a multitude of possible behaviors of traffic actors in its surrounding. We address this critical problem and present a method to predict multiple possible trajectories of actors while also estimating their probabilities. The method encodes each actor's surrounding context into a raster image, used as input by deep convolutional networks to automatically derive relevant features for the task. Following extensive offline evaluation and comparison to state-of-the-art baselines, the method was successfully tested on SDVs in closed-course tests.},

   abstract = {Bundle adjustment plays a vital role in feature-based monocular SLAM. In many modern SLAM pipelines, bundle adjustment is performed to estimate the 6DOF camera trajectory and 3D map (3D point cloud) from the input feature tracks. However, two fundamental weaknesses plague SLAM systems based on bundle adjustment. First, the need to carefully initialise bundle adjustment means that all variables, in particular the map, must be estimated as accurately as possible and maintained over time, which makes the overall algorithm cumbersome. Second, since estimating the 3D structure (which requires sufficient baseline) is inherent in bundle adjustment, the SLAM algorithm will encounter difficulties during periods of slow motion or pure rotational motion. We propose a different SLAM optimisation core: instead of bundle adjustment, we conduct rotation averaging to incrementally optimise only camera orientations. Given the orientations, we estimate the camera positions and 3D points via a quasi-convex formulation that can be solved efficiently and globally optimally. Our approach not only obviates the need to estimate and maintain the positions and 3D map at keyframe rate (which enables simpler SLAM systems), it is also more capable of handling slow motions or pure rotational motions.},

We address this question in the context of semantic visual navigation, which is the problem of a robot finding its way through a complex environment to a target object, e.g. go to the refrigerator. Instead of acquiring a metric semantic map of an environment and using planning for navigation, our approach learns navigation policies on top of representations that capture spatial layout and semantic contextual cues. We propose to using high level semantic and contextual features including segmentation and detection masks obtained by off-the-shelf state-of-the-art vision as observations and use deep network to learn the navigation policy. This choice allows using additional data, from orthogonal sources, to better train different parts of the model the representation extraction is trained on large standard vision datasets while the navigation component leverages large synthetic environments for training. This combination of real and synthetic is possible because equitable feature representations are available in both (e.g., segmentation and detection masks), which alleviates the need for domain adaptation. Both the representation and the navigation policy can be readily applied to real non-synthetic environments as demonstrated on the Active Vision Dataset [1]. Our approach gets successfully to the target in 54% of the cases in unexplored environments, compared to 46% for non-learning based approach, and 28% for the learning-based baseline.},

While sparse point-based SLAM methods provide accurate camera localization, the generated maps lack semantic information. On the other hand, state of the art object detection methods provide rich information about entities present in the scene from a single image. This work incorporates a real-time deep-learned object detector to the monocular SLAM framework for representing generic objects as quadrics that permit detections to be seamlessly integrated while allowing the real-time performance. Finer reconstruction of an object, learned by a CNN network, is also incorporated and provides a shape prior for the quadric leading further refinement. To capture the dominant structure of the scene, additional planar landmarks are detected by a CNN-based plane detector and modeled as independent landmarks in the map. Extensive experiments support our proposed inclusion of semantic objects and planar structures directly in the bundle-adjustment of SLAM - Semantic SLAM - that enriches the reconstructed map semantically, while significantly improving the camera localization. The performance of our SLAM system is demonstrated in https://youtu.be/UMWXd4sHONw and https://youtu.be/QPQqVrvP0dE .},

   abstract = {A local map module is often implemented in modern VO/VSLAM systems to improve data association and pose estimation. Conventionally, the local map contents are determined by co-visibility. While co-visibility is cheap to establish, it utilizes the relatively-weak temporal prior (i.e. seen before, likely to be seen now), therefore admitting more features into the local map than necessary. This paper describes an enhancement to co-visibility local map building by incorporating a strong appearance prior, which leads to a more compact local map and latency reduction in downstream data association. The appearance prior collected from the current image influences the local map contents: only the map features visually similar to the current measurements are potentially useful for data association. To that end, mapped features are indexed and queried with Multi-index Hashing (MIH). An online hash table selection algorithm is developed to further reduce the query overhead of MIH and the local map size. The proposed appearance-based local map building method is integrated into a state-of-the-art VO/VSLAM system. When evaluated on two public benchmarks, the size of the local map, as well as the latency of real-time pose tracking in VO/VSLAM are significantly reduced. Meanwhile, the VO/VSLAM mean performance is preserved or improves.},

At the core, it utilizes a variational auto-encoder (VAE) that encodes the semantic-metric information of the driving scene and subsequently decodes it into a 2-D planar polar coordinate system. Even without using stereo or IMU data, this VAE approach is robust to pitch and roll perturbations of the camera view. The evaluations on Cityscapes show that our end-to-end learning of semantic-metric occupancy grids achieves 59.0% mean IoU, compared to 49.2% when using a fixed-plane assumption. Furthermore, our network achieves real-time inference rates of approx. 65 Hertz for an input with a resolution of 256*512 pixels.},

To address this problem, a set of constraints are formulated, and a constructive packing pipeline is proposed to solve for these constraints. The pipeline is able to pack geometrically complex, non-convex objects with stability while satisfying robot constraints. In particular, a new 3D positioning heuristic called Heightmap-Minimization heuristic is proposed, and heightmaps are used to speed up the search. Experimental evaluation of the method is conducted with a realistic physical simulator on a dataset of scanned real-world items, demonstrating stable and high-quality packing plans compared with other 3D packing methods.},

   abstract = {Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) algorithms typically rely on a point cloud representation of the scene that does not model the topology of the environment. A 3D mesh instead offers a richer, yet lightweight, model. Nevertheless, building a 3D mesh out of the sparse and noisy 3D landmarks triangulated by a VIO algorithm often results in a mesh that does not fit the real scene. In order to regularize the mesh, previous approaches decouple state estimation from the 3D mesh regularization step, and either limit the 3D mesh to the current frame or let the mesh grow indefinitely. We propose instead to tightly couple mesh regularization and state estimation by detecting and enforcing structural regularities in a novel factor-graph formulation. We also propose to incrementally build the mesh by restricting its extent to the time-horizon of the VIO optimization; the resulting 3D mesh covers a larger portion of the scene than a per-frame approach while its memory usage and computational complexity remain bounded. We show that our approach successfully regularizes the mesh, while improving localization accuracy, when structural regularities are present, and remains operational in scenes without regularities.},

The proposed algorithms improve the scalability of the filter architectures affected by the resampling process. Problems in the particle filter implementation due to resampling are described, and appropriate modifications of the resampling algorithms are proposed so that distributed implementations are developed and studied. Distributed resampling algorithms with proportional al- location (RPA) and nonproportional allocation (RNA) of particles are considered. The components of the filter architectures are the processing elements (PEs), a central unit (CU), and an interconnec- tion network. One of the main advantages of the new resampling algorithms is that communication through the interconnection net- work is reduced and made deterministic, which results in simpler network structure and increased sampling frequency. Particle filter performances are estimated for the bearings-only tracking applica- tions. In the architectural part of the analysis, the area and speed of the particle filter implementation are estimated for a different number of particles and a different level of parallelism with field programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation.

A hybrid neuroprosthesis that combines functional electrical stimulation (FES) with an orthosis can be used to restore lower limb function in persons with paraplegia. This artificial intervention can substantially improve the walking duration vis-à-vis a sole FES walking system. However, it is unknown how to achieve optimal limb trajectories and their corresponding optimal control inputs for their use in the hybrid walking system. Optimization of limb angle trajectories and control inputs can minimize muscle fatigue due to FES and the metabolic fatigue in arms, which is caused by a user's supported weight on a walker. Thus, reduction in total fatigue, due to optimization, can further enhance the benefits of the hybrid neuroprosthesis. We show that dynamic optimization can be used to compute stimulation/torque profiles and their corresponding joint angle trajectories which minimize electrical stimulation and walker push or pull forces. Importantly, the computation of these optimal stimulation or torque profiles did not require a predefined or a nominal gait trajectory (ie, a tracking control problem was not solved). Rather the trajectories were computed based only on predefined endpoints. Different optimal actuation strategies for FES and orthosis aided gait under various scenarios (eg, use of a powered or an unpowered orthosis combined with stimulation of all or a few selected lower-limb muscles) were calculated. The qualitative comparison of these results depict the advantages and disadvantages of each actuation strategy.},

However, the hybrid actuation structure introduces certain control challenges: actuator redundancy, cascaded muscle activation dynamics, FES-induced muscle fatigue, and unmeasurable states. In this paper, a human motor control inspired control scheme is combined with a dynamic surface control method to overcome these challenges. The new controller has an adaptive muscle synergy-based feedforward component which requires a fewer number of control signals to actuate multiple effectors in a hybrid neuroprosthesis. In addition, the feedforward component has an inverse fatigue signal to counteract the effects of the muscle fatigue. A dynamic surface control (DSC) method is used to deal with the cascaded actuation dynamics without the need for acceleration signals. The DSC structure was modified with a delay compensation term to deal with the electromechanical delays due to FES. A model based estimator is used to estimate the unmeasurable fatigue and actuator activation signals. The development of the controller and a Lyapunov stability analysis, which yielded semi-global uniformly ultimately boundedness, are presented in the paper.

Functional electrical stimulation (FES) can be used to restore motor function to individuals with motion impairments; however, the duration of FES usage is limited by the rapid onset of muscle fatigue. A motor-assist can be used to compensate for the muscle fatigue by sharing work load of FES. However, it is unknown how to optimally allocate control effort to the motor-assist and FES as the muscle fatigues. Further, computing an optimal control solution is challenging given the nonlinear dynamics of the human leg system. This paper uses model predictive control (MPC) to solve an optimal control trajectory for the feedback linearized musculoskeletal system, which simplifies the optimal control problem; therefore, may reduce the computational load for MPC. The feedback linearization controller was developed for the nonlinear musculoskeletal model with fatigue dynamics where FES and an electric motor torque are the inputs. Then MPC was used on the linearized musculoskeletal system to allocate control to FES and an electric motor for regulation.

Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is the application of an external electrical potential across a neuromuscular effector to generate desired limb movements. Some of the challenges faced during closed-loop control of NMES include: an electromechanical delay (EMD) in the neuromuscular activation dynamics and uncertain nonlinear musculoskeletal dynamics. In this paper, a dynamic surface control (DSC) approach was used to design an NMES controller that compensates for EMD in the activation dynamics. EMD was modeled as a known constant delay embedded in the control input to the first-order muscle activation dynamics that is cascaded to the second-order uncertain musculoskeletal system. The DSC approach was employed to avoid the 'explosion of terms' associated with an integrator backstepping approach. The Lyapunov stability analysis confirmed that the DSC approach achieves semi-global uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB) tracking for the delayed musculoskeletal system.

   abstract = {© 2014 by ASME. To date, a functional electrical stimulation (FES)-based walking technology is incapable of enabling a paraplegic user to walk more than a few hundred meters. This is primarily due to the rapid onset of muscle fatigue, which causes limited torque generation capability of the lower-limb muscles. A hybrid walking neuroprosthesis that combines FES with an electric motor can overcome this challenge, since an electric motor can be used to compensate for any reduction in force generation due to the muscle fatigue. However, the hybrid actuation structure creates an actuator redundancy control problem; i.e., a closed-loop controller must optimally distribute torque between FES and an electric motor. Further, the control inputs to FES and an electric motor must adapt as a skeletal muscle fatigues. We consider these issues as open research control problems. In this paper, we propose that a model predictive control (MPC)-based control design can be used to optimally distribute joint torque, and can adapt as the muscle fatigue sets in. Particularly, a customized quadratic programming solver (generated using CVXGEN) was used to simulate MPC-based control of the hybrid neuroprosthesis that elicits knee extension via FES and an electric actuator.},

A widely accepted model of muscle force generation during neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is a second-order nonlinear musculoskeletal dynamics cascaded to a delayed first-order muscle activation dynamics. However, most nonlinear NMES control methods have either neglected the muscle activation dynamics or used ad hoc strategies to tackle the muscle activation dynamics, which may not guarantee control stability. We hypothesized that a nonlinear control design that includes muscle activation dynamics can improve the control performance. In this paper, a dynamic surface control approach was used to design a proportional-integral-derivative (PID)-based NMES controller that compensates for electromechanical delays in the activation dynamics. Because the muscle activation is unmeasurable, a model-based estimator was used to estimate the muscle activation in real time. The Lyapunov stability analysis confirmed that the newly developed controller achieves uniformly ultimately bounded tracking for the musculoskeletal system. Experiments were performed on two able-bodied subjects and one spinal cord injury subject using a modified leg extension machine. These experiments illustrate the performance of the new controller and compare it with a previous PID-based controller with delay compensation controller that did not consider muscle activation dynamics in the control design. These experiments support our hypothesis that a control design that includes muscle activation improves the NMES control performance.},

The walking duration of gait restoration systems that use functional electrical stimulation (FES) is severely limited by the rapid onset of muscle fatigue. Alternatively, fully actuated orthoses can also be employed to restore walking in paraplegia. However, due to the high power consumption of electric motors the walking duration of such devices are limited by the charge of the batteries. This paper proposes that a hybrid system, which uses FES and an actuated orthosis, is capable of achieving greater walking durations than an FES only system and more energetically efficient than a lower-limb exoskeleton. This is illustrated through results of optimizations of a musculoskeletal gait model for three actuation cases: FES only, electric motors only, and a hybrid system. The presented results illustrate that a hybrid system may be capable of greater walking durations than FES-based systems while using half the energy of a lower-limb exoskeleton.},

   abstract = {© 2016 American Automatic Control Council (AACC). The torque generation capability of muscles often reduces during a functional electrical stimulation (FES) session due to the rapid onset of muscle fatigue. Hybrid rehabilitation systems that use FES and electric motor assist may overcome this issue. The primary control challenge in such a system is how to allocate control inputs between electric motor and FES during muscle fatigue and muscle recovery. One strategy is to switch between FES and the electric motor by using an estimate of the muscle fatigue. This would allow the system to switch from using FES to using the electric motor when the muscle torque output has significantly decreased, then switch back to FES once the muscles have sufficiently recovered. This paper uses a second order sliding mode controller cascaded with a feedback linearization controller for a switched, FES and electric motor, system. The second order sliding mode is achieved through the use of a variable-gain super-twisting algorithm. A Lyapunov stability analysis was used to prove asymptotic stability of the switched control system. Simulations of the developed controller on a hybrid knee extension model illustrate that prolonged knee movements can be elicited through the switched system.},

Methods: An offline dynamic optimization method, constrained to a modified Hill-Huxley model, was used to determine the minimum number of pulses that would maintain a constant desired isometric contraction force. Results: Six able-bodied participants were recruited for the experiments, and their quadriceps muscles were stimulated while they sat on a leg extension machine. The force–time (F–T) integrals and peak forces after the pulse train was delivered were found to be statistically significantly greater than the force–time integrals and peak forces obtained after a constant frequency train was delivered. Discussion: Experimental results indicated that the optimized pulse trains induced lower levels of muscle fatigue compared with constant frequency pulse trains. This could have a potential advantage over current FES methods that often choose a constant frequency stimulation train. Muscle Nerve 57: 634–641, 2018.},

In this paper, we demonstrate the initial testing of a semi-active hybrid walking neuroprosthesis. The semi-active hybrid orthosis (SEAHO) supports a user during the stance phase and standing while the electric motors attached to the hip section of the orthosis are used to generate hip flexion/extension. FES in SEAHO is mainly used to actuate knee flexion/extension and plantar flexion of the foot. SEAHO is controlled by a finite state machine that uses a recently developed nonlinear controller for position tracking control of the hip motors and cues from the hip angle to actuate FES and other components.},

However, IMUs are generally prone to drift, external magnetic interference, and measurement noise. This paper presents a new class of nonlinear state estimation technique called state-dependent coefficient (SDC) estimation to accurately predict joint angles from IMU measurements. The SDC estimation method uses limb dynamics, instead of limb kinematics, to estimate the limb state. Importantly, the nonlinear limb dynamic model is formulated into state-dependent matrices that facilitate the estimator design without performing a Jacobian linearization. The estimation method is experimentally demonstrated to predict knee joint angle measurements during functional electrical stimulation of the quadriceps muscle. The nonlinear knee musculoskeletal model was identified through a series of experiments. The SDC estimator was then compared with an extended kalman filter (EKF), which uses a Jacobian linearization and a rotation matrix method, which uses a kinematic model instead of the dynamic model. Each estimator’s performance was evaluated against the true value of the joint angle, which was measured through a rotary encoder. The experimental results showed that the SDC estimator, the rotation matrix method, and EKF had root mean square errors of 2.70°, 2.86°, and 4.42°, respectively. Our preliminary experimental results show the new estimator’s advantage over the EKF method but a slight advantage over the rotation matrix method. However, the information from the dynamic model allows the SDC method to use only one IMU to measure the knee angle compared with the rotation matrix method that uses two IMUs to estimate the angle.},

Unlike many current large-scale EKF SLAM techniques, this algorithm computes a solution without relying on approximations or simplifications (other than linearizations) to reduce computational complexity. Also, estimates and covariances are available when needed by data association without any further computation. Furthermore, as the method works most of the time in local maps, where angular errors remain small, the effect of linearization errors is limited. The resulting vehicle and map estimates are more precise than those obtained with standard EKF SLAM. The errors with respect to the true value are smaller, and the computed state covariance is consistent with the real error in the estimation. Both simulated experiments and the Victoria Park dataset are used to provide evidence of the advantages of this algorithm.},

New computing technologies (SIMD coprocessors, multi-cores) can greatly accelerate the system processing but require rethinking the algorithm implementation. This paper presents an efficient implementation of the EKF-SLAM algorithm on a multicore architecture. The algorithm-architecture adequacy aims to optimize the implementation of the SLAM algorithm on a low-cost architecture (Dual-core and Dual SIMD coprocessor). Experiments were conducted with an instrumented platform. Results aim to demonstrate that an optimized implementation of the algorithm, resulting from an evaluation methodology, can help to design embedded systems implementing low-cost multicore architecture operating under real time constraints. &copy; 2012 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Although cluttered indoor scenes have a lot of useful high-level semantic information which can be used for mapping and localization, most Visual Odometry (VO) algorithms rely on the usage of geometric features such as points, lines and planes. Lately, driven by this idea, the joint optimization of semantic labels and obtaining odometry has gained popularity in the robotics community. The joint optimization is good for accurate results but is generally very slow. At the same time, in the vision community, direct and sparse approaches for VO have stricken the right balance between speed and accuracy. We merge the successes of these two communities and present a way to incorporate semantic information in the form of visual saliency to Direct Sparse Odometry - a highly successful direct sparse VO algorithm. We also present a framework to filter the visual saliency based on scene parsing. Our framework, SalientDSO, relies on the widely successful deep learning based approaches for visual saliency and scene parsing which drives the feature selection for obtaining highly-accurate and robust VO even in the presence of as few as 40 point features per frame. We provide extensive quantitative evaluation of SalientDSO on the ICL-NUIM and TUM monoVO datasets and show that we outperform DSO and ORB-SLAM - two very popular state-of-the-art approaches in the literature. We also collect and publicly release a CVL-UMD dataset which contains two indoor cluttered sequences on which we show qualitative evaluations.

   abstract = {We present a method for detecting objects in images using a single deep neural network. Our approach, named SSD, discretizes the output space of bounding boxes into a set of default boxes over different aspect ratios and scales per feature map location. At prediction time, the network generates scores for the presence of each object category in each default box and produces adjustments to the box to better match the object shape. Additionally, the network combines predictions from multiple feature maps with different resolutions to naturally handle objects of various sizes. SSD is simple relative to methods that require object proposals because it completely eliminates proposal generation and subsequent pixel or feature resampling stages and encapsulates all computation in a single network. This makes SSD easy to train and straightforward to integrate into systems that require a detection component. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC, COCO, and ILSVRC datasets confirm that SSD has competitive accuracy to methods that utilize an additional object proposal step and is much faster, while providing a unified framework for both training and inference. For 300×300 input, SSD achieves 74.3% mAP on VOC2007 test at 59 FPS on a Nvidia Titan X and for 512 × 512 input, SSD achieves 76.9% mAP, outperforming a comparable state of the art Faster R-CNN model.

   abstract = {In this work we address the task of semantic image segmentation with Deep Learning and make three main contributions that are experimentally shown to have substantial practical merit. First, we highlight convolution with upsampled filters, or 'atrous convolution', as a powerful tool in dense prediction tasks. Atrous convolution allows us to explicitly control the resolution at which feature responses are computed within Deep Convolutional Neural Networks. It also allows us to effectively enlarge the field of view of filters to incorporate larger context without increasing the number of parameters or the amount of computation. Second, we propose atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) to robustly segment objects at multiple scales. ASPP probes an incoming convolutional feature layer with filters at multiple sampling rates and effective fields-of-views, thus capturing objects as well as image context at multiple scales. Third, we improve the localization of object boundaries by combining methods from DCNNs and probabilistic graphical models. The commonly deployed combination of max-pooling and downsampling in DCNNs achieves invariance but has a toll on localization accuracy. We overcome this by combining the responses at the final DCNN layer with a fully connected Conditional Random Field (CRF), which is shown both qualitatively and quantitatively to improve localization performance. Our proposed 'DeepLab' system sets the new state-of-art at the PASCAL VOC-2012 semantic image segmentation task, reaching 79.7 percent mIOU in the test set, and advances the results on three other datasets: PASCAL-Context, PASCAL-Person-Part, and Cityscapes.

This approach is composed of three modules: graph-based SLAM using directional endpoint features, polygon map construction, and exploration. Different from existing approaches in the field of 2-D SLAM, the newly proposed 2-D graph-SLAM is based on 3-D ``directional endpoint'' features; on this basis, a well-known data structure ``circular-doubly linked list'' is applied to construct a novel polygon map for navigation. Note that it is efficient for circular-doubly linked list to initialize and update the polygon map. In addition, we propose a new information entropy calculation approach to quantify the entropy of the polygon map. Then for each candidate goal, we could obtain corresponding information gain and make next decision through collision detection. Comparative experimental results with respect to the well-known Gmapping and Karto SLAM are presented to show superior performance of the proposed graph-based SLAM. The autonomous exploration experiments in the office and hallway environments show the effectiveness of the proposed approach for robotic mapping and exploration tasks.},

In this paper, we present adaptive techniques for reducing this number in a RBPF for learning grid maps.

This drastically decreases the uncertainty about the robot's pose in the prediction step of the filter.

This study examined 858 Dutch nonagenarian (males≥89 years; females≥91 years) siblings from 409 families, without selection on health or demographic characteristics. Nonagenarians were divided over sex-specific strata according to their levels of IGF-1, IGF binding protein 3 and IGF-1/IGFBP3 molar ratio. We found that lower IGF-1/IGFBP3 ratios were associated with improved survival: nonagenarians in the quartile of the lowest ratio had a lower estimated hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) of 0.73 (0.59 – 0.91) compared to the quartile with the highest ratio (ptrend=0.002). Functional status was assessed by (Instrumental) Activities of Daily Living ((I)ADL) scales. Compared to those in the quartile with the highest IGF-1/IGFBP3 ratio, nonagenarians in the lowest quartile had higher scores for ADL (ptrend=0.001) and IADL (ptrend=0.003). These findings suggest that IGF-1 axis parameters are associated with increased old age survival and better functional status in nonagenarians from the Leiden Longevity Study.},

These systems record enormous amounts of video; therefore a key component is a stereo matcher which can process this data at speeds comparable to the recording frame rate. Furthermore, urban environments are unique in that they exhibit mostly planar surfaces. These surfaces, which are often imaged at oblique angles, pose a challenge for many window-based stereo matchers which suffer in the presence of slanted surfaces. We present a multi-view plane-sweep-based stereo algorithm which correctly handles slanted surfaces and runs in real-time using the graphics processing unit (GPU). Our algorithm consists of (1) identifying the scene's principle plane orientations, (2) estimating depth by performing a plane-sweep for each direction, (3) combining the results of each sweep. The latter can optionally be performed using graph cuts. Additionally, by incorporating priors on the locations of planes in the scene, we can increase the quality of the reconstruction and reduce computation time, especially for uniform textureless surfaces. We demonstrate our algorithm on a variety of scenes and show the improved accuracy obtained by accounting for slanted surfaces. © 2007 IEEE.},

  abstract = {In 2005 DARPA labeled the realization of viable autonomous vehicles (AVs) a grand challenge; a short time later the idea became a moonshot that could change the automotive industry. Today, the question of safety stands between reality and solved. Given the right platform the CPS community is poised to offer unique insights. However, testing the limits of safety and performance on real vehicles is costly and hazardous. The use of such vehicles is also outside the reach of most researchers and students. In this paper, we present F1/10: an open-source, affordable, and high-performance 1/10 scale autonomous vehicle testbed. The F1/10 testbed carries a full suite of sensors, perception, planning, control, and networking software stacks that are similar to full scale solutions. We demonstrate key examples of the research enabled by the F1/10 testbed, and how the platform can be used to augment research and education in autonomous systems, making autonomy more accessible.},

   abstract = {Fisheye cameras offer a large field of view, which is important for several robotics applications as a larger field of view allows for covering a large area with a single image. In contrast to classical cameras, however, fisheye cameras cannot be approximated well using the pinhole camera model and this renders the computation of depth information from fisheye stereo image pairs more complicated. In this work, we analyze the combination of an epipolar rectification model for fisheye stereo cameras with existing dense methods. This has the advantage that existing dense stereo systems can be applied as a black-box even with cameras that have field of view of more than 180° to obtain dense disparity information. We thoroughly investigate the accuracy potential of such fisheye stereo systems using image data from our UAV. The empirical analysis is based on image pairs of a calibrated fisheye stereo camera system and two state-of-the-art algorithms for dense stereo applied to adequately rectified image pairs from fisheye stereo cameras. The canonical stochastic model for sensor points assumes homogeneous uncertainty and we generalize this model based on an empirical analysis using a test scene consisting of mutually orthogonal planes. We show that: (1) the combination of adequately rectified fisheye image pairs and dense methods provides dense 3D point clouds at 6-7 Hz on our autonomous multicopter UAV; (2) the uncertainty of points depends on their angular distance from the optical axis; (3) how to estimate the variance component as a function of that distance; and (4) how the improved stochastic model improves the accuracy of the scene points.},

  abstract = {We present here a list of items that can be used to become familiar with, when trying to "tune" the RealSense™ D415 and D435 Depth Cameras for best performance. It is not meant to be exhaustive. It is also not a tutorial on depth sensors. It is a checklist to refer to when getting started. More information can be found at https://realsense.intel.com/intel-realsense-downloads. 1. Start by operating at optimal depth resolution for the camera a. D415: 1280x720 b. D435: 848x480 c. Lower resolutions can be used but will degrade the depth precision. Stereo depth sensors derive their depth ranging performance from the ability to match positions of objects in the left and right images. The higher the input resolution, the better the input image, the better the depth precision. d. If a lower resolution is required for the application for computational reasons, we recommend using post-processing algorithms to immediately subsample (decimate) the higher resolution depth map and color image AFTER the data has been received. The only compelling reason to set the D4xx cameras into a lower resolution mode would be to i. Reduce the minimum operating range, which will scale with the x-y resolution, ii. Reduce the bandwidth on the USB3.0 bus, to allow, for example, more cameras to operate at the same time, if the bandwidth limit has been reached. 2. Make sure image is properly exposed a. Check whether auto-exposure works well, or switch to manual exposure to make sure you have good color or monochrome left and right images. Poor exposure is the number one reason for bad performance. b. Example: Good c. Example: Bad (under exposed) d. Normally, we recommend adjusting EXPOSURE first for best results, while keeping the GAIN=16 (lowest setting). Increasing the gain tends to introduce electronic noise and, while the color image may look better, the depth quality will degrade. The exposure units are},

Cameras have the potential to perceive the surroundings of MAVs for the reconstruction of their 3D structure. We equipped our MAV with two fisheye stereo camera pairs to achieve an omnidirectional field-of-view. Most stereo algorithms are designed for the standard pinhole camera model, though. Hence, the distortion effects of the fisheye lenses must be properly modeled and model parameters must be identified by suitable calibration procedures. In this work, we evaluate the use of real-time stereo algorithms for depth reconstruction from fisheye cameras together with different methods for calibration. In our experiments, we focus on obstacles occurring in urban environments that are hard to detect due to their low diameter or homogeneous texture.},

The use of learning provides flexibility with respect to input modalities (in the SLAM module), leverages structural regularities of the world (in global policies), and provides robustness to errors in state estimation (in local policies). Such use of learning within each module retains its benefits, while at the same time, hierarchical decomposition and modular training allow us to sidestep the high sample complexities associated with training end-to-end policies. Our experiments in visually and physically realistic simulated 3D environments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over past learning and geometry-based approaches.

The vehicle motion planning is an essential procedure to obtain safe and comfortable trajectories, adapting the longitudinal speed to the road legal limits and mainly to avoid the excessive lateral accelerations along the journey. Typically, the proper speed of the vehicle is intrinsically related to the curvature of the path, requiring a previous approximation of this parameter in the planning stage. In this work, a novel procedure to follow a route trajectory and speed limits considering the lateral acceleration parameter is presented. A lateral jerk equation was developed and introduced into a kinematic bicycle model predictive control formulation. An adaptive speed weight equation that depends on the lateral acceleration is presented to improve the lateral positioning. A vehicle motion control simulation, developed in Dynacar, is validated with some real tests. The results show the capabilities of the proposed approach. An accurate vehicle motion control considers the lateral acceleration to avoid unfeasibility in optimization problem.},

The Dynamic Programming algorithm is used to explore in spatiotemporal space and find a coarse trajectory solution first that encodes desirable maneuvers. Then a focused trajectory search is conducted using the "generate-and-test" approach, and the best trajectory is selected based on the smoothness of the trajectory. Analysis shows that our scheme provides a principled way to focus trajectory sampling, thus greatly reduces the search space. Simulation results show robust performance in several challenging scenarios. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.},

Safety-critical tasks that must be executed by a self-driving vehicle include planning of motions through a dynamic environment shared with other vehicles and pedestrians, and their robust executions via feedback control. The objective of this paper is to survey the current state of the art on planning and control algorithms with particular regard to the urban setting. A selection of proposed techniques is reviewed along with a discussion of their effectiveness. The surveyed approaches differ in the vehicle mobility model used, in assumptions on the structure of the environment, and in computational requirements. The side by side comparison presented in this survey helps to gain insight into the strengths and limitations of the reviewed approaches and assistswith system level design choices.},

In domains sparsely populated by obstacles, the heuristics used by sampling-based planners to navigate narrow passages can be needlessly complex; furthermore, additional post-processing is required to remove the jerky or extraneous motions from the paths that such planners generate. In this paper, we present CHOMP, a novel method for continuous path refinement that uses covariant gradient techniques to improve the quality of sampled trajectories. Our optimization technique both optimizes higher-order dynamics and is able to converge over a wider range of input paths relative to previous path optimization strategies. In particular, we relax the collision-free feasibility prerequisite on input paths required by those strategies. As a result, CHOMP can be used as a standalone motion planner in many real-world planning queries. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in manipulation planning for a 6-DOF robotic arm as well as in trajectory generation for a walking quadruped robot.},

   abstract = {For individuals that suffer from paraplegia activities of daily life are greatly inhibited. With over 5,000 new cases of paraplegia each year in the United States alone there is a clear need to develop technologies to restore lower extremity function to these individuals. One method that has shown promise for restoring functional movement to paralyzed limbs is the use of functional electrical stimulation (FES), which is the application of electrical stimulation to produce a muscle contraction and create a functional movement. This technique has been shown to be able to restore numerous motor functions in persons with disability; however, the application of the electrical stimulation can cause rapid muscle fatigue, limiting the duration that these devices may be used. As an alternative some research has developed fully actuated orthoses to restore motor function via electric motors. These devices have been shown to be capable of achieving greater walking durations than FES systems; however, these systems can be significantly larger and heavier. To develop smaller and more efficient systems some research has explored hybrid neuroprostheses that use both FES and electric motors. However, these hybrid systems present new research challenges.

In this dissertation novel control methods to compensate/inhibit muscle fatigue in neuroprosthetic and hybrid neuroprosthetic devices are developed. Some of these methods seek to compensate for the effects of fatigue by using fatigue dynamics in the control development or by minimizing the amount of stimulation used to produce a desired movement. Other control methods presented here seek to inhibit the effects of muscle fatigue by adding an electric motor as additional actuation. These control methods use either switching or cooperative control of FES and an electric motor to achieve longer durations of use than systems that strictly use FES. Finally, the necessity for the continued study of hybrid gait restoration systems is facilitated through simulations of walking with a hybrid neuroprosthesis. The results of these simulations demonstrate the potential for hybrid neuroprosthesis gait restoration devices to be more efficient and achieve greater walking durations than systems that use strictly FES or strictly electric motors.},

The complexities associated with arthroscopic procedures dictate relatively longer learning curves for surgeons with the potential to not only cause unintended damage during surgery but may cause postsurgery complications. The advancement of robotics and imaging technologies can reduce the shortcomings, alleviating some of the health access and workforce stressors on the health system. In this chapter, we discuss several key platform technologies that form a complete system to assist in knee arthroscopy. The system consists of four components: (1) steerable robotic tools, (2) autonomous leg manipulators, (3) novel stereo cameras for intraknee perception, and (4) three-dimensional/four-dimensional ultrasound imaging for tissue and tools tracking. As a platform technology, the system is applicable in other minimally invasive surgeries like hip arthroscopy, intraabdominal surgery, and any surgical site that can be accessed with a continuum robot, imaged with either stereo vision, ultrasound, or a combination of both.},

The robot interacts with the human operator via F/T sensor and interacts with the environment mainly via end-effectors. Although the environmental interaction cannot be detected by any sensors (hence unknown), passivity allows us to have natural interaction. An analysis shows that the behavior of the actual system mimics that of a nominal model as the control gain goes to infinity, which implies that the proposed approach is an admittance controller. However, because the control gain cannot grow infinitely in practice, the performance limitation according to the achievable control gain is also analyzed. The result of this analysis indicates that the performance in the sense of infinite norm increases linearly with the control gain. In the experiments, the proposed properties were verified using 1 degree-of-freedom testbench, and an actual powered upper-limb exoskeleton was used to lift and maneuver the unknown payload.},

  title={Active impedance control of bioinspired motion robotic manipulators: An overview},
  abstract = {There are two main categories of force control schemes: hybrid position-force control and impedance control. However, the former does not take into account the dynamic interaction between the robot's end effector and the environment. In contrast, impedance control includes regulation and stabilization of robot motion by creating a mathematical relationship between the interaction forces and the reference trajectories. It involves an energetic pair of a flow and an effort, instead of controlling a single position or a force. A mass-spring-damper impedance filter is generally used for safe interaction purposes. Tuning the parameters of the impedance filter is important and, if an unsuitable strategy is used, this can lead to unstable contact. Humans, however, have exceptionally effective control systems with advanced biological actuators. An individual can manipulate muscle stiffness to comply with the interaction forces. Accordingly, the parameters of the impedance filter should be time varying rather than value constant in order to match human behavior during interaction tasks. Therefore, this paper presents an overview of impedance control strategies including standard and extended control schemes. Standard controllers cover impedance and admittance architectures. Extended control schemes include admittance control with force tracking, variable impedance control, and impedance control of flexible joints. The categories of impedance control and their features and limitations are well introduced. Attention is paid to variable impedance control while considering the possible control schemes, the performance, stability, and the integration of constant compliant elements with the host robot.},

This article provides quantitative comparisons, using multiple humanoid platforms, between an improved implementation of the KDL inverse Jacobian algorithm, a set of sequential quadratic programming (SQP) IK algorithms that use a variety of quadratic error metrics, and a combined algorithm that concurrently runs the best performing SQP algorithm and the improved inverse Jacobian implementation. The best alternative IK implementation finds solutions much more often than KDL, is faster on average than KDL for typical manipulation chains, and (when desired) allows tolerances on each Cartesian dimension, further improving speed and convergence when an exact Cartesian pose is not possible and/or necessary.},

A typical challenge is to justify incorporating a torque sensor in terms of cost, system complexity, and reliability. Recently, sensorless torque estimation methods have been developed for robotic joints that include harmonic drive transmissions (HDTs). The principle is based on their relatively low torsional stiffness, which allows for estimating the transmitted torque by measuring the torsional angles (via existing joint encoders) and a compliance model. However, these methods are based on nonlinear models that are difficult to identify and tune. In this study, a simplified torque estimation method is introduced based on the structural damping friction of the HDTs. The structural damping can be correlated to the HDT torque using a simplified linear dynamic model and torsional rate measurements. Experimental results have validated the proposed method, using a robotic joint setup with an external torque sensor that has been previously utilized for testing several torque estimation methods.},

Moreover, a new concept called the "intentional reaching direction (IRD)" is proposed to quantitatively describe this intention. Both the state model and the observation model of IRD are obtained by studying the upper limb behavior modes and analyzing the relationship between the measured force signals and the motion intention. Based on these two models, the IRD can be inferred online using an adapted filtering technique. Guided by the inferred IRD, an admittance control strategy is deployed to control the motions of three DC motors placed at the corresponding joints of the robotic arm. The effectiveness of the proposed approaches is finally confirmed by experiments on a 3 degree-of-freedom (DOF) upper-limb robotic exoskeleton.},

   abstract = {A harmonic drive is a compact, lightweight, and high-ratio torque transmission device which is used in many electrically actuated robot manipulators. In this paper a built-in torque sensor for harmonic-drive systems is examined in detail. The method proposed by Hashimoto, in which strain gauges are directly mounted on the flexspline, is employed and improved in this paper. To minimize sensing inaccuracy, four Rosette strain gauges are used employing an accurate positioning method. To cancel the torque ripples, the oscillation observed on the measured torque and caused mainly by gear teeth meshing, Kalman filter estimation is used. A simple fourth-order harmonic oscillator proved to accurately model the torque ripples. Moreover, the error model is extended to incorporate any misalignment torque. By on-line implementation of the Kalman filter, it has been shown that this method is a fast and accurate way to filter torque ripples and misalignment torque. Hence, the intelligent built-in torque sensor is a viable and economical way to measure the harmonic-drive transmitted torque and to employ that for torque feedback strategies.

This is achieved by means of an Observability Constrained Extended Kalman Filter that fuses kinematic encoder data with on-board IMU measurements. By including the absolute position of all footholds into the filter state, simple model equations can be formulated which accurately capture the uncertainties associated with the intermittent ground contacts. The resulting filter simultaneously estimates the position of all footholds and the pose of the main body. In the algorithmic formulation, special attention is paid to the consistency of the linearized filter: it maintains the same observability properties as the nonlinear system, which is a prerequisite for accurate state estimation. The presented approach is implemented in simulation and validated experimentally on an actual quadrupedal robot.},

The presented approach extends that detailed in [1] on a quadruped platform by incorporating the rotational constraints imposed by the humanoid's flat feet. As in previous work, the proposed Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) accommodates contact switching and makes no assumptions about gait or terrain, making it applicable on any humanoid platform for use in any task. The filter employs a sensor-based prediction model which uses inertial data from an IMU and corrects for integrated error using a kinematics-based measurement model which relies on joint encoders and a kinematic model to determine the relative position and orientation of the feet. A nonlinear observability analysis is performed on both the original and updated filters and it is concluded that the new filter significantly simplifies singular cases and improves the observability characteristics of the system. Results on simulated walking and squatting datasets demonstrate the performance gain of the flat-foot filter as well as confirm the results of the presented observability analysis.},

The additional de-gree(s) of freedom allow to attain the same TCP pose with an infinite number of joint configurations. In this paper, we present a control scheme that allows to modify the joint configuration within the manipulator null-space, i.e. without affecting the TCP pose, on the fly by physical human-robot interaction. To do so, a null-space admittance control law is proposed that augments the existing motion control structure. The scheme relies on the estimation of joint load torques solely based on motor speed and motor current measurements. Hence, the proposed method does not require additional sensing and can be realized by means of software changes only. Experimental validation is provided by means of measurement data gathered from an ABB YuMi 1 manipulator.},

   abstract = {Legged robots require knowledge of pose and velocity in order to maintain stability and execute walking paths. Current solutions either rely on vision data, which is susceptible to environmental and lighting conditions, or fusion of kinematic and contact data with measurements from an inertial measurement unit (IMU). In this work, we develop a contact-aided invariant extended Kalman filter (InEKF) using the theory of Lie groups and invariant observer design. This filter combines contact-inertial dynamics with forward kinematic corrections to estimate pose and velocity along with all current contact points. We show that the error dynamics follows a log-linear autonomous differential equation with several important consequences: (a) the observable state variables can be rendered convergent with a domain of attraction that is independent of the system’s trajectory; (b) unlike the standard EKF, neither the linearized error dynamics nor the linearized observation model depend on the current state estimate, which (c) leads to improved convergence properties and (d) a local observability matrix that is consistent with the underlying nonlinear system. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to include IMU biases, add/remove contacts, and formulate both world-centric and robo-centric versions. We compare the convergence of the proposed InEKF with the commonly used quaternion-based extended Kalman filter (EKF) through both simulations and experiments on a Cassie-series bipedal robot. Filter accuracy is analyzed using motion capture, while a LiDAR mapping experiment provides a practical use case. Overall, the developed contact-aided InEKF provides better performance in comparison with the quaternion-based EKF as a result of exploiting symmetries present in system.},

The metric is weighted to balance each parameter's effect by normalizing the data so all parameters are more equally weighted. It is designed to combine spatial, temporal, kinematic, and kinetic gait parameter asymmetries. It can also combine subsets of the different gait parameters to provide a more thorough analysis. The single number quantifying gait could assist robotic rehabilitation methods to optimize the resulting gait patterns. CGAM will help define quantitative thresholds for achievable balanced overall gait asymmetry. The study presented here compares the combined gait parameters with clinical measures such as timed up and go (TUG), six-minute walk test (6MWT), and gait velocity. The comparisons are made on gait data collected on individuals with stroke before and after twelve sessions of rehabilitation. Step length, step time, and swing time showed a strong correlation to CGAM, but the double limb support asymmetry has nearly no correlation with CGAM and ground reaction force asymmetry has a weak correlation. The CGAM scores were moderately correlated with TUG and strongly correlated to 6MWT and gait velocity.},

Our understanding of WB-PEXO use is lagging, however, largely due to the lack of detailed evaluations via human-subjects testing of a WB-PEXO. We examined (independently from the manufacturer of a WB-PEXO) the potential impacts of using a state-of-the-art WB-PEXO prototype (pre-alpha prototype version of the Sarcos Guardian® XO®) on users ( $n=5$ ) during a common basic activity in the workplace, level walking. With emphasis on the 'human', impacts of XO use (compared to a no EXO baseline) were assessed in terms of lower limb intersegmental coordination, muscle activity, and postural dynamic stability. A larger variance between participants was observed for intersegmental coordination with XO use, and participants appeared to rely on more hip motions. When using the XO, participants exhibited higher muscle activity levels in the lower limb muscle groups monitored. Further, there was a moderate to high similarity in muscle activity profiles between the XO and no EXO conditions ( $R_\{XY\}\left (\{\tau \}\right)=0.70-0.92)$ , yet muscle activity profiles when using the XO were generally time-lagged from those without the XO. We discuss the results within the context of developing a mental model for walking with the XO, and aspects of human-robot interaction such as transparency of the XO and understanding user state and intention. In concluding, we outline several future research topics for occupational WB-PEXO development.},

Six participants (4M, 2F) completed two such tasks (load carriage and stationary load transfer), both with and without a WB-PEXO, and with a range of load masses in each task. WB-PEXO use reduced median levels of muscle activity in the back (∼42–53% in thoracic and ∼24–43% in lumbar regions) and legs (∼41–63% in knee flexors and extensors), and mainly when handling loads beyond low-moderate levels (10–15 kg).

Future work should examine diverse users, focus on finding effective matches between WB-PEXO use and specific tasks, and identify applications in varied work environments.},

Prioritized control is a widespread multi-task technique in robotics and animation: tasks have strict priorities and they are satisfied only as long as they do not conflict with any higher-priority task. Optimal control instead formulates an optimization problem whose solution is either a feedback control policy or a feedforward trajectory of control inputs. We introduce strict priorities in multi-task optimal control problems, as an alternative to weighting task errors proportionally to their importance. This ensures the respect of the specified priorities, while avoiding numerical conditioning issues. We compared our approach with both prioritized control and optimal control with tests on a simulated robot with 11 degrees of freedom.},

   abstract = {Bipedal locomotion skills are challenging to develop. Control strategies often use local linearization of the dynamics in conjunction with reduced-order abstractions to yield tractable solutions. In these model-based control strategies, the controller is often not fully aware of many details, including torque limits, joint limits, and other non-linearities that are necessarily excluded from the control computations for simplicity. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) offers a promising model-free approach for controlling bipedal locomotion which can more fully exploit the dynamics. However, current results in the machine learning literature are often based on ad-hoc simulation models that are not based on corresponding hardware. Thus it remains unclear how well DRL will succeed on realizable bipedal robots. In this paper, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DRL using a realistic model of Cassie, a bipedal robot. By formulating a feedback control problem as finding the optimal policy for a Markov Decision Process, we are able to learn robust walking controllers that imitate a reference motion with DRL. Controllers for different walking speeds are learned by imitating simple time-scaled versions of the original reference motion. Controller robustness is demonstrated through several challenging tests, including sensory delay, walking blindly on irregular terrain and unexpected pushes at the pelvis. We also show we can interpolate between individual policies and that robustness can be improved with an interpolated policy.},

   abstract = {In this paper, a new approach for dealing with multiple tracking tasks during physical interaction is proposed. By using this method, multiple tasks are accomplished based on the assigned priority in addition to a compliant behavior in the null-space of the main tasks. This issue is critical when robots are employed for complex manipulation in unknown environments and in the presence of human. During the manipulation in the dynamic environments, different objects may collide with the robot body and disturb its manipulation. In these cases, the robot is expected to continue execution of the tasks, accurately. Meanwhile, the robot should be compliant to ensure the safety during the interaction. A nonlinear controller-observer is proposed for tracking the desired trajectory based on a preallocated hierarchy. The suggested controller-observer estimates the external torques applied to the robot body without using joint torque measurements and compensates its projection on the task spaces. Asymptotic stability of the task space errors, the null-space velocity and the external interaction estimation error during accomplishing multiple tracking tasks are shown analytically. Finally, the algorithm performance is shown through experiments on a 7-DOF KUKA LWR robot arm.},

To address these challenges for bipedal locomotion, we present a model-free reinforcement learning framework for training robust locomotion policies in simulation, which can then be transferred to a real bipedal Cassie robot. To facilitate sim-to-real transfer, domain randomization is used to encourage the policies to learn behaviors that are robust across variations in system dynamics. The learned policies enable Cassie to perform a set of diverse and dynamic behaviors, while also being more robust than traditional controllers and prior learning-based methods that use residual control.
